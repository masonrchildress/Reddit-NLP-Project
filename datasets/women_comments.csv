r/AskWomen,"Husband told me over and over and over that I wasn't healthy, I was manipulative, I was slowly killing him, I needed help. 

It took a big huge blow up argument in a hotel 11 hours away from home for me to get my shit together and realize I needed to change. Still working on it, still together but not sure for how long? 

TLDR; Was so toxic I almost drove my husband to his breaking point to realize it."

Don't expect too much, some people may not want to reconnect, but I suspect if they were actually your friend before they will."
r/AskWomen,The Princess Bride
r/AskWomen,"I was married to my first husband for 10 years and we had a daughter together. I wasn’t happy for over half the marriage and after 10 years, he left for another woman. I wasn’t particularly hurt by it, it was kind of more of a relief. I could stop trying to be what he wanted me to be and start being myself.  I swore I would never get remarried again because I was intent on no man ever telling me what to do again or struggling to be accepted for who I was. When I met my current husband, I told him that I had no interest in ever getting married. Over time, he showed me what a different, healthy relationship could be like and we ended up getting married. We’ve been together for over 11 years now. He’s my best friend and it still amazes me that marriage can actually be a positive thing."

r/AskWomen,"My mom confused power/value with looking good and having money. So if I did something shitty to someone else, I would think ""oh well, at least I'm pretty. People will forgive me because I'm cute.""

How awful is that? And the money thing was more like...I don't really know how to explain it. Almost like I can use people if its advancing myself? Comments like ""marry rich, who cares about anything else."" that sort of thing. I remember in school telling my mom that people were making fun of me, and she would offer me comebacks like ""tell them 'at least my family has class.'"" Like it was all about socioeconomic status, which I now realize is SUCH a low blow.

So I'd say even if you're raising your daughter to believe in her own power, remind her that a person's value is so much more than money or physical appearance. She shouldn't judge herself by those standards, nor should she judge anyone else by those standards.


EDIT: One last thing. My parents raised me not to take shit from **anyone**, but that also led to very poor self-reflection skills. I couldn't handle someone pointing out my flaws, and would then do mean things to get back at said person. Teach your daughters actual conflict resolution skills!"

r/AskWomen,"practice closed body language, and tell yourself as many times as you need to that you don't *owe* anyone emotional caretaking. there are booming professions precisely because listening to people's problems is *work*. tiring work.

when somebody starts in with you, ask yourself ''is this amount of disclosure/the amount of emotional labour expected of me appropriate for our relationship?''. if the answer is no, think about times in your life when you've overshared, and how people communicated their discomfort. maybe their expression fell, they crossed their arms or leaned away, maybe their eyes darted to the exits before they said something non-committal like ''that sucks'' and let the awkwardness silence speak for itself. that's how a normal person reacts to an emotional boundary being crossed. 

we're just told that because we're women/abused children, it's our job to manage people's emotions, so we don't learn that we have a right to boundaries or feel like b-words for having them.

OH, also super important: start as you intend to proceed. once you've become established in somebody's mind as the Mom Friend, Nurturing Lady Friend, or Emotional Dumping Ground, it is VERY hard to change that. in new relationships/friendships, you can either disclose in kind to meet their intensity and reciprocate (not recommended if they're coming on too strong: sometimes they're trying to bait you into doing this so they have ''dirt'' on you). or shut down premature disclosures by letting things be awkward. once disclosures become more suitable for the actual intimacy of the relationship, THEN you can share more of yourself to make sure it's reciprocal."

r/AskWomen,"I worked in my school library part time in high school. New kid came to the front desk and we were chatting. He slid me his number on an index card and said he was hoping to check me out.

EDIT: Those of you PMing me are very sweet! No we didn’t date. My long time partner was cute in how he asked me out too. We were making out for the first time and all of a sudden he pulls away breathing heavy (asthma). Between bursts of air he frantically says “can I ask you out?!” I said yes. Big pause. Then a very breathy “will you go to dinner with me?!” I said yes. Lots more enthusiastic asthma-inducing kissing after that."

EDIT:
Sooo I guess I left out a good part of the story...

I was a passenger in my sister's car. He pulled up in the lane next to me to make a righthand turn, so he was already looking in my direction. I just happened to be looking in his direction as well. I noticed him and was smiling because I thought he was cute. He noticed me smiling. We rolled down our windows (we still argue who rolled down their window first). He said, ""You have a beautiful smile, call me 123-4567"". I immediately put the number in my phone and kind of forgot about it for a week to be honest. Well, I ended up calling him. We talked on the phone for a few months and ended up finding out we had a bunch of mutual friends (our sisters actually hated each other in high school lol). We both lived nearby so we agreed he'd pick me up for our first date. It went horribly haha. But I gave him another chance and now here we are..."
r/AskWomen,"When my now husband and I were dating for a few months, I played an album for him that I loved but he hadn’t listened to yet. We were cuddling on his balcony, enjoying the music and the view. As a kinda slow song ended, I felt his heart beat faster (I was leaning on him with my hand on his chest) so I looked up and asked if he was okay. He looked in my eyes and said “I know you might think I’m crazy, and you don’t have to say it back, but I love you.” My heart was full hearing him say that so genuinely, and I was so happy to say it right back. 

A few months after that, he picked me up from the airport after a trip where I didn’t see him for a few weeks, flowers and other gifts in hand. Among the gifts was a vinyl of the album we were listening to that night, he brought me home and we danced to the vinyl in my room. 

He’s so sweet to me. I love him with all my heart."

But both times were pretty magical."
r/AskWomen,"I have a black flag tattoo and a minor threat tattoo and when I was younger guys would stop me at shows and tell me to “name the lead singer in 82’” “name five songs” etc.  I never really participated in these kinds of conversations and would just walk away which of course lead to shouts of “it’s because you can’t!”. Okay, yeah, you’re right. I went and got a permanent tattoo to impress the guy in a small town hardcore band who works as a cashier at CVS. Not because I have my own likes and interests."
r/AskWomen,"I keep the litter boxes scooped and clean. I also keep my cat as well-hydrated as I can so her pee is more diluted and therefore (ideally) less smelly. We feed her wet food almost exclusively, and we add about half a can of water to every can of food. We also leave a water dish out for her, and clean it and refill it with filtered water. We have a fountain, but she's afraid of it, so she won't use it.

She is in good health and secure enough in her territory and place in our home, so she doesn't pee anywhere except in her boxes. I don't think our place smells bad unless it's been too long between box-scooping. My sister, who hates cats and is very sensitive to their smells, has also said that she can't really smell the litter box or anything.

I've got a wax warmer for when I want the place to smell *nice* instead of just neutral."

r/AskWomen,Suffered considerable trauma from an ex and was unsuccessful in finding a new relationship for ten years. Then I decided to give Tinder one more try and met my wonderful SO. It's almost like I needed to endure and experience life on my own to become the person I am now. Like they say you can't love another until you love yourself.
r/AskWomen,"No regrets, not even once. I'm 56. Two of my siblings had children. One brother did not. I was tempted at one point, long ago, after the birth of one of my nephews. Spending time taking care of him led me to imagine a life oriented around taking care of a child. I know I would have been a good parent. And yet my main reason for even thinking about it was so that I would have a ""clear purpose."" At the time, I was struggling to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, my career, my relationship. If I had a child, taking care of the child would have become the answer to all areas of doubt. Or at least, a commitment I would prioritize and fulfill at the expense of deciding what to do about my purpose, my career, my relationship. In any case, that was not a good enough reason to become a parent, at least by my reckoning. Now, decades later, I've had to wrestle with answering those questions, figure out how to become the best version of myself, know myself, respect myself, for my own sake. I love my nieces and nephews. And I love the life I have on my own."

r/AskWomen,"I was the biggest slob as a teenager now my house is tidy but lived in. 

Start small 

-make your bed EVERYDAY 

-wash all dishes wipe down counters and stove before you go to bed. 

I find starting the morning with a clean kitchen then seeing my bed made makes me want the other things clean too. 

Keep cleaning things organized to make 5 minute jobs easy to to do

Example I keep a bottle of rubbing alcohol with a spray on it with a roll of paper towels under my bathroom sink so I I can wipe down the sink, counter and mirror quickly.  
I like alcohol because it can be used on most surfaces without streaking and sanitizes the area. 

Set a timer for small tasks. 20 minutes a day everyday will work wonders on how your home looks for general tidiness. 

Pick 1 day once or twice a month to do a deep clean.  Blast some music and really clean all the nooks and crannies once you spend that time getting everything clean you will want to keep it that way."
r/AskWomen,I stopped making effort and didn't keep in touch.
r/AskWomen,"My ex was one of those men who are traditionally attractive: tall, masculine face, athletic. While on the other hand, I wasn't so much of a model myself. I'm the most average looking person you will ever meet, and that sentence didn't even come from myself, someone actually said that when I was in high school.

One of the most tiring thing besides having much hotter girls try their shot at him is when people comment on how hot he is and how he could've done so much better. This is because his exes are incredibly hot, even I don't understand why he chose me at the time. His friends' surprised mixed with confused faces when they met me was heartbreaking. His cousin's asking how his ex was in front of me was tormenting. It made me extremely insecure, not because of my ex, but because of the people around him who are used to his attractiveness and his attractive partners.

We broke up after 6 months of dating because he cheated on me with his model & pageant ex-girlfriend. It was a dark time for my self confidence."

r/AskWomen,"That’s not my current situation but used to be. 

He was generally fine with it although sometimes he felt pressured, by himself, to..i don’t know how to explain it. He felt like, since I did not have friends, that he needed to fill a much larger space in my life than he already did. 

For example, going to lunch with me because I went alone. It made him feel guilty that I was alone. But that was self imposed and he got over it once he actually listened when I said I was okay with my alone time and lack of friends."

r/AskWomen,The Blurred Lines lyrics.
r/AskWomen,"I'm 27. I talk about it sometimes online, and it's a combination of things like a bad childhood, social awkwardness, early puberty causing MORE awkwardness, and mostly the fact that I've never been allowed to enter a relationship until I was 18, and then the 2 relationships I had after that were abusive. Over the last two years, I've started something with someone who is NOT abusive, but due to our collective issues, the timing for sex, just hasn't been right. But, talking to people IRL; I've actually found myself having to lie about it. I'm not sure if it's a geographical thing, or what, but I notice that whenever someone outright asks me if I'm a virgin or when they last time I ""got some"" was - and reply that I am a virgin, I get treated very differently; almost childlike. I pay my own bills, I live in my own house, and I work 40 hours a week, but as soon as I admit that I've never had sex, I've literally watched friendships diminish as I say it. At work - I watched the other women go from treating me like a contributing member of the team, to basically ignoring me as I speak; but it's not just there. It's like as soon as someone realises, I become less of an 'adult' or less worthy of a conversation in their eyes.

r/AskWomen,"My kidney stone was worse, but the fact that I didn’t know (at the time) it was a kidney stone, played a big role I guess. It hurt continuously for several hours, I threw up from the pain and I was convinced I was going to die for sure...because it just cannot be harmless when it hurts THAT much.
With my baby I knew in advance it was going to hurt, and I knew why, and I knew what’s happening with my body. I also knew there will be a reward at the end of it🙂. So it wasn’t as bad as kidney stone.
Also, contraction pains roll over as a wave and there’s a little bit time to rest between them. That was definitely not the case with my kidney stone. Yeah, stone was worse."
r/AskWomen,"When I was younger and stupid and had no self esteem, I tried. He still cheated on me. For four years. I just didn't think I could do any better, and since every person I'd ever been with up to that point cheated on me, I sincerely believed ""that's just how men are"". 


Now? *Fuck* no! Why would I waste my time on someone who doesn't respect me?"
r/AskWomen,[deleted]
r/AskWomen,"What you're experiencing is called cognitive dissonance. When you've been told your whole life that having sex is bad, but then you decide to have sex whether just because or you got married, it can be hard to make those two things line up. Sex is bad =/= healthy sex life. 

I personally didn't have too many issues with libido. I have no idea why. I guess maybe because my family was a little more liberal than other families of the same religion. 

I still think some things are just big NOs. I don't do, or haven't done, casual sex. No one night stands. I think heavy porn usage isn't a good thing. Maybe all of that is just common sense or maybe it's still left over from all of those ""you can't unlick a cupcake"" lessons I had in church. 

The good thing is that sex therapy is a thing now. There are people out there who can help you with negative associations with human sexuality. 

There is part of it that is just reframing how you view something, which can honestly be hard. There's still a part of me that's like, ""Oh, this person had sex with like 200 people, that's gross,"" and I have to tell myself that people like that are out there and it doesn't mean they're some kind of sex demon out to destroy families, religious beliefs, and possibly the world with their sexiness or that they're a walking petri dish of STDs; they're just people who like sex, as most of us do."

I don't really go places where someone would approach a date, and I live in the suburbs where it's not really common to talk to other people when they do chores. was_locked"
r/AskWomen,"It was very difficult for me. When I moved, I got catcalled to and fro. It infuriated me but it wasn’t safe to tell the men to “eff off”. Once, I was walking down the street in a mini skirt and and an old woman came up behind me and tried to tug it down because she thought it was unladylike. When I ate in public, men used to yell at me that I was going to get fat. I was angry most days."
r/AskWomen,"I had this phase in high school where I was dating frat guys. One guy was really cute but essentially ghosted me. I decided I wanted to know why so I knocked in the door to his frat house not realizing it was some sort of meeting night. So I was this dopey high schooler asking a literal house full of college guys if Aaron was there. Serious, embarrassed cringe."
r/AskWomen,"i wound up eventually finding a job, but what got me through was finding pals who were also job searching. it was a lot less depressing to realize people i respected and thought were awesome were also struggling, and it's that it's hard, not that i sucked.

r/AskWomen,"the fact that my male best friend DIDN'T do this, and instead waited for me to break up the dude and decide for myself, was the deciding factor in me going with him. i might have been open to him saying something before then, but he would lose points for not respecting my relationship or my choices for sure."

r/AskWomen,"Well as they say, ""out of sight out of mind,"" so when I'm not in public, I don't think of them at all unless they did something directed towards me. 

But in public I confess I'm a bit of a people watcher so I do take to speculating on their lives whenever I'm sitting in a mall for an extended period of time. It's not exactly just something I do out of boredom either, sometimes random passersby can make for the most interesting people to take notice of."
r/AskWomen,"Save compliments.

Seriously. In my journal, I have things like ""Son said I'm the best mom ever today"" and ""Twin Bro liked my outfit, which is huge because he doesn't even pay attention to fashion"" and ""Did a difficult thing at work and Boss said he's glad I was the one working on it because he knew it would go right.""

When I feel like crap about myself, I can read back in my journal and see that I have it in me to earn these compliments."

r/AskWomen,"The elderly gentleman in Target when my daughter was 2 & on the verge of a tantrum. My husband had been deployed for 3 months at that time, out of a 9 month deployment, and I didn't have much patience left before my own tantrum. He gently rested his hand on top of mine & told me I was doing all the right things and to ignore the judgy looks from strangers. It was such a simple act of kindness & empathy that was enough to put me back in the right headspace to console my daughter."

It’s not perfect, and some fights have required a couple “do over” cards, but it works for us. 14 years strong.

r/AskWomen,"I have found it to be true. But the reason i think it ‘works’ isn’t because you just stop looking, its because you change your focus from searching for someone, to investing in yourself. You focus on what you want, how you want your life to look like like, what you want it to involve. And when you know what you want, and are working to get there, it’s easier to be be compatible with someone that wants the same things in life."
r/AskWomen,When he was in college he hosted a “chicken nugget party” and made a bunch of different dipping sauces. Nobody showed up to his party and he just ate a massive amount of chicken nuggets by himself. I wish I didn’t know because it makes me sad to think of my lovable goofy husband gorging himself on chicken nuggets all alone but it also makes me giggle and then I feel bad.
r/AskWomen,"When i started to date my current boyfriend 2 years ago, I was 30 and i had already one year single and before him I was on a two years relationship that was emotionally exhausting and toxic. Nevertheless, during the end of that relationship I learned for myself what I appreciate and wanted in a relationship. So I had decided for myself that I did not wanted fool around anymore, I wanted someone that was on the same emotional and mature place that I was.

So after dating for a month came the conversation, I was straight forward honest and i said that I like him and I can see myself developing deeply feelings for him if we continue dating. So i asked how he feel towards me, as the answer was positive, I mentioned that I wanted that we are exclusive and that i wanted that he is honest, even if was about the most awkward topic. I said to him that we were mature enough to talk if there is something to talk to. 

After around 1month later, it came the topic about if we go into a relationship or not and then I was straight forward with him (I was honestly scare of the outcome of this comment). 

I said: I want to go into a relationship with you, but you have to be aware that I am not going into a relationship ""just to see what could happen"", but because I would invest my emotions and enery on us to make it work and be happy and build something positive from this. And if you want to go into a relationship with me I will expected the same from you. This does not mean that we will have to get marry, however i would like to start something that will move forward and if you think that this is too much for you, then i don't think I will be able to go into a relationship with you, because i know what i want""

Thanks God, he said that he wanted the same :) so well here we are two years later, still in love, engaged and buying our first home. And getting soon a dog :)"
r/AskWomen,"I'm ready when it comes. I love my mom so much that its overwhelming but I've set up my life to make sure she will be taken care of when the time comes. She will be with me. My fiance and I are on the same page with coliving with our parents in their old age. Hes already done it with his grandma and agrees it's the best situation while they're still of sound mind but weaker body. 

If they start wandering of course that's another situation but for now she will have her house until its obvious that she needs to stay with me. Which will probably be in like 10-15 years. She can come earlier and we'll rent her house if she pleases to help pay for an aide should she need one. 

Man, this stuff gets me choked up. But idk, I'll never abandon her. My mom is my heart. I'm an only child and idk. I cant imagine just leaving her or pawning her off when that time comes. Life is cyclical. The caregivers become the cared for. I could never abandon her because shes never abandoned me. Shes loved me with her entire heart and I'm happy to pay her back when she needs me. She deserves rest. She deserves grandbabies on her lap while I make dinner with her recipes. She truly deserves peace and love"

r/AskWomen,"I realized my worth as a human being was innate and not determined by my job, my education, or what people think of me. I am worthy of being treated with respect and kindness. 

Plus I decided to live my best life out of spite as a fuck you to everyone who was ever mean to me. So yeah, that works too."
r/AskWomen,"Are there any styles or pieces you go for? I think Girlfriend Collective does athleisure with fabrics made from recycled plastic bottles. Reformation and Eileen Fisher are also a brands that claims to do sustainable clothing. I think it's Patagonia that usually encourages people to learn how to mend their clothing instead of buying from them on Black Friday sales, so that's pretty cool of them.

Even if you can buy secondhand it's more sustainable - you're taking something that's already in circulation and giving it a longer life. 

It can take a lot of research and even then some brands who claim to be sustainable may not be. It depends on what's important to you. Denim and cotton often require a lot of water to grow and process them however I prefer cotton over synthetics that are made from plastic. Synthetics tend to age poorly (you see them a lot in fast fashion) and little bits of the fibers can go into the air and the water. Some fabrics like bamboo and tencel are sometimes touted as green but some critics argue that these have to go through so much processing to become a fabric that they aren't really that green (probably like thinking a French fry should be considered a healthy vegetable). Some accreditation for sustainable or ethical practices can vary.

Also, fast fashion is everywhere, even the higher brand stores can have fast fashion-y type pieces. I guess if you're interested you can educate yourself on what makes a quality garment (such as the stripes matching at the seams) so you can assess it for yourself when you're shopping. I'm a textiles nerd so I'm kinda into that sort of stuff!"
r/AskWomen,I ALWAYS feel like people don’t like me as much as they like my friends who are more extroverted. I feel like I’m super awkward and because I don’t put myself out there as much people forget about me and don’t invite me to things and it makes me feel like inadequate sometimes.
r/AskWomen,"I didn't fuss over having a big wedding so I kept it simple and wasn't too concerned about details like what my bouquet would look like. I just picked white roses. I also only had one bridesmaid and told her to wear whatever she wanted but to tell me the color of her dress so I could match the flowers to her dress. It was yellow so I just ordered her some yellow lilies.

The day of the wedding, my bouquet turned out nice but I thought hers was awesome. Meh, no biggie. During the reception at some point though, I joked to my husband that I got the shaft on the bouquets.

Six months later, I get a delivery to my office with the exact same yellow bouquet my bridesmaid had. Apparently six-month anniversaries are a thing (I had no clue but I guess the hubby looked it up), so he got me the yellow flowers and an engraved iPod. He gets permanent brownie points for that one!!!!"

r/AskWomen,"When I am sitting at a table with my family (father's side. on my mom's side there's just my mom), it feels like my brother's partner is more a part of it than I am.

I don't know why. There's no specific reason I can pinpoint. It just feels like I am sitting with someone else's family, looking in. None of them know how to talk to me, what to say to me, or who I actually am. They have an idea of who I am and no matter how many times I tell them I am not that person, they don't believe me. I am the black sheep, 100%. 

My political beliefs are different, my religious views are different, my sense of humor is different, my course in life is radically different.

They don't react to me, I don't think. They just either pretend I'm not there or act like I am an alien/foreign concept while trying to make conversation.

I'm not actually in contact with any of them, anymore. So this should all me in past tense."

r/AskWomen,"It's going pretty well so far. After a summer where my ex-girlfriend and my boss both made a lot of comments about my appearance that made me uncomfortable, and I struggled with an eating disorder, I said ""Fuck it,"" buzzed my long blonde hair down to the skin in the bathroom sink, took my belly button piercing out, and mostly stopped wearing makeup and transitioned from skirts and pushup bras to cargo pants and band shirts.

I just decided that, since trying to be attractive just led to me starving myself, getting unwanted attention, and feeling the need to compete with other women, I'd rather just opt out of the game altogether and focus on my work. It's been a few years since then and I'm much happier with my body, I don't obsess over my appearance anymore, and I have a fiance who tells me I look badass and helps me shave my head. I haven't weighed myself in almost two years and I haven't counted calories in even longer, and yet I've lost a few pounds, I think. Sometimes I still feel self-conscious around women in my field who are smart AND beautiful, but I'll settle for just being smart and happy."

r/AskWomen,"When I was a kid I had a large book, covered in rough blue fabric.  The story was about a mean young prince who made fun of an old woman.  Turns out she was a witch.  She turned him into a donkey.  When winter came he found her Frozen in the snow with icicles all over her.  The prince, now having learned his lesson, defrosted her with his breath.  Turns out she was the witch.  She turns him back into a boy.

The drawings fascinated me.  Parts of them were in pointillism.  I felt sorry for the donkey.  He had a difficult time picking berries and putting them in his basket.

I lost it then found it.  Some years ago we had a fire in our house and I lost it.  Was terribly upset.  I still look for it.

Out of anger I went straight to my hair dressers to cut it all off and I thought that would solve my problems but sadly, it has not lol."
r/AskWomen,"Trial and error, and personal growth. Working toward communication, and avoid escalation to the arguing.

r/AskWomen,Rugs. Even fairly cheap ones from Target. You add personality and homey-ness. Soft on the feets too.
r/AskWomen,"Jump.

Just jump. Define the boundary you have, find a place on the otherside of it, and then run and jump.

My philosophy of doing hard things is: don't think about it until you're in it. For example, say I have to go somewhere I know I don't want to that is out of my comfort zone. Then I just set myself in motion to do this, but the entire time on the way there I am intentionally distracting myself away from it and forcing myself to think of something, anything, not it. Then before I know it, I'm there, and past my comfort boundary."

r/AskWomen,"This is subtle, but we developed the pat-pat.

The pat-pat is a method whereby, if we are cuddling, and one party wants to leave, they give the other and affectionate pat-pat. This way, there's no feeling of surprise when the other pulls away, which can be mildly hurtful if done suddenly. The pat-pat is usually followed by a kiss.

Similar to the pat-pat is the hand-squeeze. Holding hands has gone on too long? Sweaty and hot? One quick hand-squeeze signals affection before pulling away.

It's so subtle, but I never did this with previous partners, and I find it increases feelings of intimacy and appreciatation."

They looked really good though and I loved showing them off to my SO. I've thought about doing them again, but I think I just don't have the best nipples and they'd have to get pierced either pretty deep or right through previous scar tissue."
r/AskWomen,"Tbh I am still wracked with guilt about it. Things weren’t healthy between us (for a long time) but instead of confronting it head-on with her I drifted away until she called me out (and then just said I felt okay with us drifting apart).

She was my life for 24 years and I still feel that hole. I miss her a lot but I try to deal with that by reminding myself of how bad things had gotten in the ~2 years leading up to the end. 

I’ve tried to put more effort into other friendships and family since, and I try to have faith that I’ll have a healthier version of that partnership down the road."
r/AskWomen,"I was at a pub in London waiting for a friend who had been delayed. This guy sat next to me and we started chatting, and at some point started talking animatedly about old time female singers (you know, Edith Piaf, Maria Callas, and the likes). He bought me two drinks, and I could swear he was being very flirty. I was about to tell him I’m gay when, irony, he gets a text message and says “Oh, great! My boyfriend will be here in 5 minutes! You have to meet him, he also loves Edith Piaf!”. Well, I did meet him, and he was indeed lovely. When my friend eventually arrived the four of us stayed there for a couple more hours.

r/AskWomen,"This is gonna get downvoted, but I think it’s important to take a realistic approach.

[This article](https://markmanson.net/being-average) really helped me. There is always going to be someone better-looking, smarter, and more talented than you. 

So maybe this person is more attractive than me. Maybe she has more going for her. That also very well may not be the case, but either way, there is more than likely absolutely nothing I can do about it. If I lose my shit every time I see or encounter someone who I perceive as being better than me in some way, I know I’m going to have a bad time because there are billions of people in the world. 

I challenge myself every day to decondition the competitive, “make more, do more, be more” mindset instilled in capitalistic societies. It’s hard and takes practice but I strive to accept myself and my limits unconditionally and to find validation and love from within instead of from others. 

Everything in life is framed to be a race and a contest and it’s a scam. But whether you fit with someone in a relationship is so individual and nuanced that it’s impossible to assign an accurate value judgment to that. If someone isn’t rip-roaring enthusiastic about being your partner, you’re not losing by not having them around. If you put on a shoe that’s not your size and it doesn’t fit, it isn’t your fault and it’s better to look for one that’s comfortable than get your feet beat up and blistered by trying to force it. They aren’t for you and there’s nothing wrong with you. Give yourself time to recover, brush the dirt off your knees, and keep going."

It seems that it was out in the open back then (40/50) when the neighbor MOVED IN with my Gram and her husband. Her husband had his own room and Gram and the neighbor lived together in another.

I wrap my tampons in toilet paper and my pads in the plastic wrap they come in and put them in the bathroom bin (which we all take turns emptying) I don't care if someone opens the cupboard and sees the unused ones I put them in there for myself and anyone who needs them. If you see a used one you're in the bin and what do you expect when digging around a bin"
r/AskWomen,"Greek salad, tofu green curry, spicy vegetarian pad thai."
r/AskWomen,"I get more frequent extreme behavior from men -- a higher percentage of men's interactions with me are either extremely nice or terrifying. When I am dressed normally men act more neutrally polite towards me (not overly attentive and not aggressive) 

The aggressive/terrifying behavior has never been worth any compliments or door-holding I may receive, mostly because sometimes a man can go from seemingly nice/polite to terrifying in under 3 seconds (smiles and holds door, I say ""thank you"" and walk through, and then he follows me and gets aggressive and scares me and says I owe him something. . no thanks) I've always hated it, so I avoided dressing up for most of my teens and 20s unless I was going to be glued to my boyfriend for the night. 

I get treated slightly better by women when I am dressed up with no noticeable negatives. When I am dressed up they are more likely to strike up a conversation about something I am wearing (shoes, purse, dress, whatever) so in that way it feels they are nicer. When I'm not dressed up women are also pretty nice/polite to me."
r/AskWomen,They were in the same boat. They had very little experience also so it was something new for the both of us.
r/AskWomen,"I used to be a chef but the stress got to be too much. I decided to start a dog walking and doggy day care business. I have been doing it for a year now and absolutely love it. I just started advertising locally, made a website and went for it. I now have many regular clients and although the money isn't amazing, it's enough to live on and I couldn't be happier."

r/AskWomen,"I go to court tomorrow for my legal name change. I'm adopting my step-fathers last name, as is my wife. We didn't take each others names, hence us both getting a court ordered legal name change.

I'm worried they'll deny us for some reason even though we both have a clean record and nothing outstanding. It's just nerves I think lol."
r/AskWomen,"I was in a relationship that ended prematurely because my boyfriend passed away after losing his battle with cancer. After some time, I tried to move on/start dating again, but I felt like I couldn’t give myself physically or emotionally to someone new. In many ways, I’m still working through it. He’ll always hold a special place in my heart but I don’t want that to interfere with a new relationship. I have plenty of room in my heart and plenty of love to give. :)"

Girl I paid a few Gs for it, it's absolutely mine. 😂"
r/AskWomen,"Yes! I did. The deciding factor was that I got into one of the best grad schools in the country for my career (journalism.) Don't regret it at all because I was part of a team that was awarded a Pulitzer Prize this week, which was cool. But more importantly, I'm so happy every single day I get up to go to work, and I couldn't ask for anything more."
r/AskWomen,"Ok, first of all... Bran being like, ""Ain't nobody got time for this useless small talk,"" was every fan watching the show. A fucking ice dragon is flying south and you jerks are still standing around. Also why wasn't anybody appropriately horrified by this news. It was bad enough when they thought that one dragon was dead, but now they know that a dragon can be turned into a wight, and their dragons can't help deal with the white walkers as long as their zombie brother is coming for them. Essentially their dragon advantage has been reduced in short order from three to one, and if they lose either of the remaining two dragons, it'll be advantage Night King.  

Dany is getting more insufferable by the minute, and judging from many of the episode recaps published last night, I'm not the only one who finds the romance between her and Jon to feel really forced. Jon and Ygritte had amazing chemistry. You really felt for them. The struggle between their feelings for each other and their opposing loyalties was completely believable. Jon and Dany are pretty bleh in comparison. 

Sansa has become one of the very best characters on the show and I'm glad to see that she's fully come into her role as Lady of Winterfell. She had legit concerns about their lack of resources to feed two armies and two dragons, and all Dany had to offer was a snarky little clapback. Her blase attitude made both her (and Jon for bending the knee to her) look like a-holes in front of all the Northern lords. And did Dany really complain to her boyfriend like, ""Your sister doesn't like me, so I don't like her.""

I wonder, now that Sam broke the news to Jon about his real identity, how quickly word will get around. I suppose Sam would keep it a secret if Jon asked him to, but Bran has zero filter these days, and may not keep quiet if Dany starts popping off about being the rightful heir to the kingdoms. Especially since she's not exactly endearing herself to the Northerners, if she starts something I'm pretty sure Bran would put her in her place with the truth."

r/AskWomen,"My answer to this question really depends on when you ask me but as of this moment...

I'm 30 years old. Why the hell am I still dealing with breakouts?!"
r/AskWomen,My biggest problem is I can’t properly communicate my feelings to friends and significant others. I’ve been in therapy for a long time and I still just can never seem to do it. If something’s bothering me I can never speak up and say what I’m feeling. Therapy has helped me recognize that I do this for multiple reasons. It’s a protective mechanism because I am afraid of angering people and setting them off and then abandoning me. I also have evolved to subconsciously believe that I do not have a right to speak my mind. I don’t have a right to my feelings and my needs aren’t important. I bottle it all up inside until someone says or does something and I pop off. And when I say pop off I mean pop the fuck off and it shocks people. I will go into a blind furious rage and destroy everything in my path and I have lost so many friends and significant others because of this. Don’t have kids if you’re not gonna treat them right man...
r/AskWomen,Little Women
r/AskWomen,"Whatever it is, don’t keep talking if they don’t. I don’t know how to articulate that better. But men often talk to me and I don’t want them to, so I am polite but then I don’t give them good body language or keep the convo going, and they do and it’s one sided and I want to die. I’m sure there are signs I’m giving off they’re ignoring and it’s not just “oh she’s quiet “"
r/AskWomen,"Ive dated someone whos legally blind. He can still see while wearing both contacts and glasses. Though not very clear.

Ive just accepted that when he takes off stuff he cant see. Its part of who he is and i dont really notice.


I know you must mean someone who cant see a thing. Id see it as they love you for the person you are....which can be more genuine than a sited person."

r/AskWomen,"At reception of my workplace we have a small stand that contains the Australian flag, the Aboriginal flag and the Torres Strait Islander flag.

It sat there for ten minutes before someone stole the Australian flag when the receptionist was in the kitchen.  30mins later she was yelled at because 'Why do you only have that Abo flag in there!  Why are you such fucking racists?  What's wrong with Australia?'

Got another Australian flag in there and stuck it in with superglue.  By the end of the day the flag had actually been broken off.

Then the stand was moved so as to be on the desk behind the safety glass.  That glass has spaces so that we can pass things to people.  Someone eventually reached their arm through and stole the whole thing.

Now we have the three flags pinned to the wall behind the desk."
r/AskWomen,"Wash them inside out. It may not completely eliminate the problem, but I find it definitely makes a difference. 
As for dealing with clothes that are already affected, just shave the pills off. You can use a disposable razor, tape a razor blade to a comb, or there are razors especially made for this."
r/AskWomen,"I started doing them before getting pregnant as a preventative measure, and I still do them a few times a week 12 years later. I guess they worked because I've never had any of the sneeze/pee issues that happen to some women, so I've got that going for me, which is nice."
r/AskWomen,"I was a girl scout and also a bit of a fire enthusiast. I had my One Match patch and everything. 

Later on in college, bonfires and camping trips were the popular thing to do. I remember the first time I went with a group of friends to a beach bonfire I stepped aside and let a few of the boys get it started. After about 20 minutes they still hadn't gotten the wood to catch and I asked them to please step aside and let me try to do it on my own. I had the fire going in just a few minutes and I saved the evening. My friends were astounded that of all people, I was the master fire starter."
r/AskWomen,"A guy pretended be from France: faked an accent, gave me an entire backstory. We were in a bar with a bunch of my friends from college and I wasn't really interested in him, but he kept droning on about the little vineyards he visits and coffee shops he likes near his house. 

About an hour later, he told me he was faking the entire thing and just did it to impress me. Suffice to say, I was not impressed in the slightest."

r/AskWomen,I've been hearing that since the 1980s.  I think people are unrealistic.
r/AskWomen,"*I* obviously found them attractive despite whatever they were insecure about, so I upped my genuine compliments about them and shared with them whenever I heard/saw a friend or even a random stranger check them out."
r/AskWomen,"It’s probably pretty mundane in the greater scheme of things, but I was putting a compression bandage on a patient’s leg, and suddenly out of the blue he said “I bet your husband really likes your breasts. I like large breasts, too.” I was completely confused, like, what the hell does that have to do with your leg? Not used to people commenting on my appearance. And alcoholism and dementia is a bad combo."
r/AskWomen,"I recommend checking out the detailed instructions at /r/ABraThatFits.  But here's the basic run down.  

The number indicates number of inches around the rib cage, measured under the breasts.  The letters indicate the ratio/difference between THAT number and the measurement at the fullest part of the breasts.  So yes, while letters later in the alphabet generally mean 'bigger', there's a lot of visual difference between a 30C and a 40C, for example.  A C-cup isn't an absolute size."
r/AskWomen,"I interrupt people when they're speaking.

I get so excited about what I want to say and how I can relate to this person that I have a hard time stopping myself. And sometimes I apparently just cant tell when someone is ""done"" with their statement.

I really do try to fix it, and I apologize when I catch myself doing it. I know it's rude; it's just hard to change."

In the bedroom he mixes things up, doesn't skip foreplay and is a really passionate kisser. He constantly tells me that I am sexy and beautiful, inside and outside of the bedroom. It doesn't hurt that I also think he is very handsome! Excited to spend the rest of my life sleeping with him."

r/AskWomen,"I would say thanks! I don’t mind a genuine compliment. Just don’t try to touch me or my hair. Big difference between admiring someone and invading their personal space. If I like someone’s clothes or shoes or whatever else, I don’t touch them - I just pay them the compliment and move along. So I would like that same courtesy extended to me."
r/AskWomen,I have short curly hair. I always did a pony tail my entire life. High buns and low buns. Always pulled back. Never ever wore it down. I went to a curly hairstylist to get it trimmed because it was always breaking. She said I was losing a ton of hair in the center of my head from wearing buns and pony tails all the time. She cut all my hair and gave me the right products to wear it out. Took some time but I only wear it out now. It’s growing so much and so healthy
r/AskWomen,"This always happens to some degree with shorts and underwear. My thighs/butt just like trapping material. I umm wear a lot of skirts? Then it’s really only the clinging fabric to your butt and not thighs.

r/AskWomen,"All the time. I'm huge supporter of the idea of being your own best friend and talking to youself in your own head like a super best friend would. It's tempered with not being delusional and holding myself accountable, but yeah, there are thousands who'd cut me down, the least I can do is pick my ownself up like this."
r/AskWomen,"Are we counting mental illnesses as well? Because if so dont even get me started lol. But I also have endometriosis and at work Ive always gotten the classic ""psht its just a period suck it up"" bullshit and then Im like actually my uterine tissue is growing where it isnt supposed to and causing tumor like clumps of tissue to form and its extremely painful. That usually shuts em up haha."

r/AskWomen,"CBD oil did absolutely nothing for me. I smoke a *very* small amount of weed before bed, now, and that does more for me than any CBD product I tried."
r/AskWomen,"Ugh what a joke. All this woman wants to do is run competitively, and now she can't do that. She can't run as a woman and she can't run as a man. All this ruling does is take someone's passion away because of completely unfair and unscientific perceptions of gender, and that's sad. 

Like another poster said, I'm concerned about the specificity of the ruling and what stereotypes about race and gender presentation have to do with it. I would bet *serious cash money* that if she was white, straight instead of gay, had delicate facial features and long hair, with exactly the same running times, she would not be in the position she is today. People would praise her natural ability like they praise Usain Bolt's ridiculous running advantages. Even if it turned out that Bolt had a natural biological advantage like four calf muscles instead of two or whatever, they wouldn't ban him from running professionally forever. That wouldn't be fair."
r/AskWomen,"Are you asking in terms of our bodies? I'm not sure that I face any sexual or specifically women problems *daily* aside from discharge. 

Monthly? PMDD, bloating, hormonal breakouts, blood coming out of my vagina, cramps.

Generally? I'm prone to UTIs from penetration, no matter how clean we both are. Also have pain with sex.

And no biological male has ever worried about being pregnant, so there's that."
r/AskWomen,"Sleep in late, masturbate, make myself a delicious breakfast, go see an early movie with some buttery ass popcorn, come home, give myself a manicure/pedicure, watch trashy TV or cliche movies that I love, drink rose, order in Chinese food, take a longggg bath (more wine + a book), probably masturbate again, fall asleep watching something else trashy.

If you don't live alone, get a hotel room to do all of this and sub ""make delicious breakfast"" with ""get room service breakfast."""
r/AskWomen,"I make this pretty much every day I’m in a rush: 
Half a frozen banana, cup of berries, almond milk, plant protein (mine isn’t flavored), flax seed meal, almond butter, cinnamon! 

Banana, peanut butter and chocolate protein with almond milk is also great. 

Banana and açaí packet, plant protein.. 

You can also add greens (mild tasting ones like spinach), chia seeds, honey, etc."

r/AskWomen,"It took me a while to get it right but I got there in the end. I worked in retail all the way through uni, graduated with a useless psychology degree and fell in to sales because of my customer service experience. I hated it - while I'm good with numbers and data and organisation, I'm not outgoing enough, not pushy enough, and too easily offended. After a couple of years in two different sales jobs I started thinking about a change of career and settled on procurement. It uses most of the same skills but you don't actually have to convince anyone to do anything, so it's more suited to me - and it's not so high pressure, which is doing wonders for my mental health. I'm one of two in the purchasing team for large charity and I absolutely love it. Really found my niche."
r/AskWomen,"I grew up in a village. As a kid, it was awesome. All the places to go - the forest, the caves where bats lived, the ponds to swim in, the cherry and apple trees in summer and fall.    
As a teenager, it was rather boring. Internet connection was barely a thing in the 2000s, the bus to the city came three times a day. If I wanted to go anywhere on the weekends or after 7pm, I had to ask my parents to pick me up with the car. 

As an adult, I now live in the city and love it. I can walk to the grocery store and to the library, to the doctors and the cafés. If there's a party, I can take the tram or walk home at 3am. Everything I want is available."
r/AskWomen,Make yourself busy. So busy that you're exhausted by all of the things you're doing. You don't even have time to be lonely. That's me.
r/AskWomen,Lindt. Their truffle bar is amazing.
r/AskWomen,"I actually moved across the world to a country where I didn’t know anyone. I went to an international university so I found friends that way. Now that I’m out of university, I make new friends through work. through friends of friends, and through activities such as yoga class. Several of my friends here have become family to me, we spend our holidays together (except for holidays that I spend visiting family back home). My life is more fulfilling than it ever was back in the US, and I believe that’s because of making a completely fresh start."

r/AskWomen,"Yeah. It’s weird and it’s hard. My feelings toward my dad are a bit warmer, even though stuff he did made me crazy sometimes, but he was never mean. My mom was really complicated and kind of messed up from her bizarre and messed-up childhood. Now as an adult, I do truly understand her, understand that it was her subconscious running the show, and I know that I’m forgetting some of the good things. But in general I still have a lot of anger/anguish about her, though I keep trying to resolve it. It’s hard. It’s not like I loved my dad more, but I remember fewer bad things about him. I remember fewer good things about my mom, and that makes me feel guilty. I don’t know. How about you? What are you wrestling with?"
r/AskWomen,"Currently (top two are pretty constant):

r/AskWomen,"My grandma used to have her period during all her fifth pregnancy, she also gained almost no pound until the seventh month. She sometimes felt a little sick, but that’s not a proper red flag, you know"
r/AskWomen,"All the hardass ice queen stuff was just a wall I put up to protect a really sensitive, vulnerable, gentle soul.  The wall was so thick and so tall that I forgot, over the years, there was anything inside of it.  I became the wall - the walls feelings (protect protect protect, don't let anyone in) became my feelings.  Eventually the wall became so claustrophobia-inducing that I sort of melted down, and now brick by brick it builds up over time but brick by brick I work to keep it where at least I can see over it and climb over it.  Hiding behind it has started to feel uncomfortable, rather than automatic, which has allowed me to live more, love more, let people in, really connect and know my own self."
r/AskWomen,"Having more spontaneous sex and having sex in the daytime! I know my s/o loves my body but us initiating outside of a dark bedroom feels, idk, special? Like whoa he wants to see all of me *in the sunlight*.

Sex in the dark is still cool too though I prefer it if I've consumed too much lasagna"
r/AskWomen,"I've heard the saying that, your automatic thoughts are what you've been conditioned to think due to upbringing, and your secondary thoughts are your *actual* thoughts. (Not the exact words but my memory is crap)

I've definitely caught myself thinking shitty things about other women. But I try to challenge myself when I have judgemental thoughts about anyone. Just continue catching and re-thinking your negative thoughts when you notice them, and they should become less frequent over time."
r/AskWomen,"Let me TELL you. It was at an incredibly high reviewed place in West London. I got a discount via a booking site (£15 instead of £50 holla). I was so worried when I went in because I have quite thick hair and I sweat easily. She didn't give a lot of information about what to do. She left me alone in a room and told me to get undressed from the waist down but then what? Eventually she came back in and my dream came true - SHE PUT ON 'SEX AND THE CITY' for me to watch, while getting waxed. It honestly made the whole experience 100 times better because I could distract myself. It was so so painful at first but it got even worse once she moved downwards. So when she moved back up, it felt fine. I felt super weird getting my butthole waxed because she put me in an upright cradle pose haha"
r/AskWomen,"I'm in an interracial relationship (WM/BW), and he gets upset because my dark foundation gets on his face when we make out and makes him feel like he's doing blackface 🤷🏿‍♀️"
r/AskWomen,"I read a self help book on this once, which was long, but one part of it stuck out that I remember: Thank people for things instead of apologizing.  

It's not gonna work every time, but the concept is like this... Instead of saying you're sorry for needing help from someone, thank them for helping you.  Instead of apologizing when you think you've taken too much of someone's time, thank them for taking the time to do whatever it is.

It helped me because it gives me something to say when I feel I need to say something, but without diminishing myself, and turning the interaction positive.  And I do really appreciate what that person's done.

Besides that though I do recommend locating and reading some self help books on it, because LOTS of them exist and they point out stuff that makes you conscious of your interactions and what you mean to say vs. apologizing."
r/AskWomen,"Working out regularly, saving money, and paying off debt.

r/AskWomen,Yoga pants. Probably two dozen pairs of yoga pants and tops from Lulu. It was so bad that my credit card company called thinking it was fraud. Most of them were on back order so the packages kept arriving at our house for weeks. Every time I would think they had all arrived another would show up.

r/AskWomen,"I’ve volunteered with Crisis Textline since 2016. It’s 100% free, anonymous, and available by text message 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 

It’s very fulfilling to be able to help people who might not have anyone else to reach out to. I also really love that it allows me to volunteer at odd hours from home. 

It can be frustrating though as well, because it’s not intended to replace ongoing therapy, but some regulars try to use it that way."
r/AskWomen,Ann and Nancy Wilson from Heart
r/AskWomen,"Realize that there is no one person you are meant to spend your life with, it's better to figure it out sooner rather than later and waste precious years with someone that isn't right for you.

Get active, make new friends, do new things. I believe humanities ultimate goal is to experience new things, why else would we have this insatiable drive to go where we haven't before, or see things we haven't seen, to understand and discover. Pour all that time you'd spend in a relationship into becoming a better you. Investing in yourself will never be a waste, and your future partner will surely thank you for your efforts and all the new things you bring into their life.

I realized that what i'd experienced and the relationship id lost wasn't the be all end all, it was simply the opening of a new door and new chapter in my life."
r/AskWomen,"OH, I have the best story for this! This occurred about 2 years after my divorce. I was dating a guy in San Antonio (I lived in Austin, as did my ex). We had planned to go to a running event in SA where we would trail run a few miles, then party at a pool the rest of the evening. Three days of this! It was glorious!

I walked in to the first day's event and, lo and behold, I see my ex husband with his new fiancee sitting at the bar. I had never met her before and I couldn't escape without looking like an ass. So, I cheerily walked over and introduced myself to her. As I shook her hand she says, ""Oh, I've been wanting to talk to you for a long time now. We should go to the bathroom.""  I thought to myself, ""OK, we're doing this now.""

As we enter the bathroom, I tell her that I have absolutely no animosity toward them and I wished them hundreds of fat children. (Stolen line from my favorite TV show) The door shuts and she turns and says, ""So, when you were with him, was he.... very.....*selfish*?"" I froze in fear and had no idea what to say. She unloaded all of the problems and issues of their relationship right there in that public bathroom. It was all of the same issues I had, just magnified. Because he WAS a selfish asshole. 

I instantly liked her. She needed someone to vent to, apparently. After about 15 minutes, someone opens the bathroom door and says, ""Hey, you two, everyone is shitting bricks because you are still in here.""  We leave, laughing. 

My ex looked like he really was about to shit a brick. She and I bonded over that weekend! She was very lovely and super sweet. WAY too good for him. While in the pool drinking beer after the run, she confided in me that she was leaving him soon. I felt very sad for her, but glad she could get out faster than I did."

r/AskWomen,"I hope I don’t have to be worried about money.  I’ve spent the last 10 years with student loans and other debt, and am hoping it’s finally paid off in the next 3 or so years.  With that extra money, I’ll be able to save a better emergency fund and just have a little extra.  It’s almost $800 a month so will be life changing!"
r/AskWomen,"I have every Sunday news-free and usually drama-free -- I don't read the news, either don't check social media at all or only look at 'safe' places and if I'm going to watch a movie or something I don't choose something that will make me cry. I also don't go anywhere if I don't want to if it's not a life and death situation, no excuses. One of my best decisions. It really makes me recharge and every week I have at least one day to look forward to."
r/AskWomen,"The men turn to me for a lot of emotional support, but don't return the favor. I tread lightly because too often guys interpret emotional support and comfort as attraction/ romantic feelings."

r/AskWomen,"An elderly lady (71 I found out) in my estate stopped me (25) as I was getting into my car today and asked if I would give her a lift somewhere as she had a hoover to bring with her so obviously couldn't lug it around with her. So naturally I gave her a lift to the shops.

We chatted along the way about travelling and just life in general. As I was dropping her home she stated that her door was always open for a cup of tea. I reckon I'll pop in some time next week!"
r/AskWomen,"Self care! Carve out some time to do something you really enjoy:

- Take a new class. Maybe an art class, gym class, anything that pleases you

- Indulge in your favorite novel/tv show/movie

- Take a bath. Relax

- Eat your favorite food for dinner or dessert

- Talk to your Person. Sometimes we just need someone to listen, or make us laugh.

- Be healthy. Get enough sleep! It is really important."
r/AskWomen,Truth? It was so bad that I had my tubes tied a year after I had my only child because I could not go through it again.
r/AskWomen,"No longer in a FWB situation, but I was for over a year before entering my current relationship.

Basically, there was no rhyme, reason, or routine to how often we hooked up.  Sometimes we would multiple times in a week/month and then we wouldn't again for another month or so.  We were friends first, so we still hung out in these times, we just didn't hook up.  Usually if we were at a party together or one of us had been partying - that was guaranteed to initiate one of us contacting the other for a hook up.  Sometimes, we'd be hanging out and just feeling it and go for it.  Sometimes one of us would just be feeling horny and contact the other. It's pertinent to note that we were both still seeing other people, so for lack of a better phrasing we were essentially the others ""Last Resort"".  Dry spell? No one around? Don't feel like trolling the hook up apps?  Call the other person!

As far as who initiated it - it really depended.  I definitely was the one more likely to reach out first over phone to initiate a hook-up, but if we were already hanging out, he was the one more likely to initiate it then."
r/AskWomen,"Honestly, I just powered through it.

Went to bed earlier so I could get 8-9 hours of sleep. Drank a lot of hot tea/water. Tried to keep relaxed and stress-free. Noticed that if I was stressed out during this time, the flu stayed even after my period was done."
r/AskWomen,"Try to give people genuine little compliments regularly. They don’t even have to be compliments per se, but just little accolades. For example: “hey, how’s your degree going?.... I really admire that you’re both working and in school. You’re working so hard.” Or “Hey, good morning! How’s (SO)? Aww, you guys are sweet together.” Just ask about something important to that person and segue it into a compliment. It cheers people up and makes them feel cared for.

Also, it’s worthwhile to find a charity you care about and donate on special occasions or whenever you feel moved to do so!

Just the fact that you’re thinking about this is a good sign, btw :) Kudos!"

r/AskWomen,"Redirecting the conversation.

Once some guy in the bar asked me to help him work the jukebox. I'm oblivious to the idea that this might be pretense to flirt with me until he asks me what my favorite Marvin Gaye song is in a sort of suggestive tone.

So I told him I like ""What's Going On"" and started monologuing about how music often reflects the political climate of the time in which it was created and how you can almost study historical events through the progression of musical topics.

I think he just walked away at some point."

r/AskWomen,"I [American female] had a really good time as an au pair for a Chinese family in Beijing when I was 18. 2 parents, one 4 year old boy, none spoke English. Mom and son studied English with me, dad worked a lot. I was there for 6 months.

I helped out around the house but by no means did they make me do anything that they weren't also doing. It was just chores-if you live in a house and eat together you're responsible for some of the cleaning/cooking.

Pros: The company I was with payed for my flights, a monthly salary, and I had 2 days off per week plus two weeks of vacation, one week for every 3 months. They offered Chinese lessons on the days off, which gave me a chance to get together with the other au pairs (who were from all over the world, it was amazing).

Because only wealthy families can afford an au pair, you're almost guaranteed to live in a nice apartment, go to high end restaurants, and be taken on vacation (you're responsible for caring for the kids while there but still, I couldn't afford any of those meals/hotels). I went to Hong Kong, Disney, and the North China Sea. I ate amazing food, both in fancy restaurants and from street vendors. I have incredible souvenirs and memories.

Cons: the cultural barrier was really hard. I would offend them or vise versa, or we would disappoint each other because we'd have different expectations. The language barrier made it even harder because we couldn't apologize or explain ourselves as well as we wanted to. You're living together, so there's tension sometimes, and it can't be resolved like it normally would be. That party sucks. But I wasn't treated like a ""slave"".

All in all though I loved them a lot. I see little boys with brown hair and wonder what my little guy looks like now, almost a teenager. I think about my host dad's funny smile and the way my host Mom would give me a hug from the side when we were in the kitchen together-and I miss them a lot.

Do your research, be safe, but if you want to do it - go."
r/AskWomen,"Made fast friends with a woman through a group of other friends. 

She was kind, witty and had a great energy about her that drew people to her. 
Then she was diagnosed with terminal cancer and we were all devastated. 
Instead of feeling sad and sorry for herself, she threw herself into raising awareness for the type of cancer she had. We set up a charity and fundraised... She was struggling with her health and also financially and she was still trying to help other people before her own needs. 
I was in awe of her strength and compassion for others and I was devastated that such an amazing woman was being taken from this world too soon. 

Long horrible story short, one of my friends and I found out by accident that she never had cancer at all. 
She wasn't donating the money. She was keeping it for herself. 
She wasn't dying, she was just a shitty person with shitty intentions. 

Broke my trust in people for such a long time."

r/AskWomen,"My father died when I was young so this isn't necessarily a ""good vs bad relationship"" question, but more of a ""whether the father exists or not"" question."
r/AskWomen,"The first time I was a martial arts instructor.

I had been doing various martial arts trainings for 15 years and I still saw myself as a student until my instructor was sick and asked if I could lead class that day.  After a brief moment of confusion, I looked around and realized I had 5-10 years more training than anyone else present.

Edit: meant sick, not such."
r/AskWomen,I don't. It's impossible unless I put it in a ponytail or bun and use lots of gell for the frizz - which I don't do because I feel I look like an egg head with my hair back.
r/AskWomen,"Practicing vulnerability and mindfulness has helped me a lot.

Listening to and respecting needs as they come. 

Acknowledging feelings in any given moment with understanding and without judgement.

Determining what thoughts are healthy/unhealthy, compassionate/uncompassionate and by that cultivating healthy, compassionate ways of being.

Basically treating yourself as you would a loved one. 

Our relationship with ourselves is unending until we die; we are stuck with ourselves, so it's in our best interest to make it a healthy, positive relationship."

r/AskWomen,"A few! I have an iPhone, so these are iOS apps, but almost certainly also available on android.

**Stocard** \- Allows you to scan the barcodes of all your membership cards and gift cards and keep them in an app, rather than hauling them around in your wallet.

**Letterboxd** \- This is like goodreads for movies. You can track which movies you watched, when you watched or rewatched them, rate them, read reviews, make watch lists, recommendation lists, etc. I'm a movie junkie so I love this thing. The userbase is generally pretty young, so the reviews actually feel relevant. I also love that it sends you stats at the end of the year (similar to goodreads) on how many movies you watched, which actors or directors you seemed to like...useless info that I really enjoy.

**Google Keep** \- Maybe everyone knew about this app except me, but I only discovered it in the last year or so, despite being a pretty avid user of all of Google's other apps (sheets, docs, etc.) It's a cloud-based note-taking app, and it's way more functional than all the others I've used, including the built-in iOS app. Because you can share notes with people, my boyfriend and I use it for our grocery list, our meal plan, household chores, travel ideas, Halloween costume brainstorming, and probably other stuff. I individually use it for things like wardrobe planning, gift ideas, plant care, saving random links, personal shopping lists, jotting down writing ideas, reddit mod work to-do lists...pretty much everything."

r/AskWomen,"Wait until after you’ve had (and solved) your first few conflicts. You already know who you both work together when times are great, but you won’t know how you do in a fight/disagreement/misunderstanding. If you know you’re compatible with your communication style and problem solving you’ve got a better shot at lasting. Living in such close proximity to your SO offers lots and lots of opportunity for conflicts, from tiny (puts clothes beside the hamper, not in the hamper), to  larger (disagreement about who does what household duties/finances/pet care). Having the matching skills to work through the small, everyday stuff, gives you an idea on how’s you deal with much harder things."

r/AskWomen,"I haven't seen it yet but if it is *accurate*, I'd like to. I am interested. 

I also don't have a problem with Zac Efron playing Ted Bundy. I've seen stills from the movie, and photos of Ted Bundy, and there is a likeness. Ted Bundy has been described as handsome and charming, he was *that* guy, why would we have someone with 0 likeness play him? And just because Zac Efron has played ""great hot guy"" in other movies does not mean he can not diversify his career and roles. 

 It's also not glorification to make a movie about the earlier life of a serial killer. In today's society, there is a desire to learn about the innerworkings of serial killers and about their lives outside of their killing - from my knowledge, that is what this movie is giving us.

Yes, Bundy was a narcissist who would love to know this movie is happening. But he's dead."

r/AskWomen,">  if you haven't seen any red flags by that point, there probably aren't any 

Really untrue. Calculated, manipulative, and skilled abusers will wait well over a year until they begin being abusive. Some will even wait until marriage.

Red flags can happen at any point in time, even if you've been together for years. The question shouldn't be ""*when* do you notice red flags"" but ""*how* do you notice red flags."""

r/AskWomen,"The most meaningful came from my boss in our final one on one. I told him I fear where I'll end up with him leaving, how my position does not exist within the company and how the new person will not know why I'm in it and what I'm capable of. He replied with, ""Anyone who spends more than five minutes with you in a work setting knows what you're capable of. I promise [your new boss] will see it immediately.""

Before he left he got me contracted to a new title position and made all of our 'part time' (read: full time workers without benefits) contracted as full time, with full benefits.

A good boss."
r/AskWomen,"I have three children through adoption. 
My ex husband and I spent thousands and thousands on fertility treatments. 

There was a lot of blame. Self blame that is. My fault for not being able to carry. My fault for having endometriosis. My fault for all the miscarriages. 
My ex blamed himself for a low sperm count. In his head if he had stronger sperm it would have been different. 

None of that blaming made an ounce of difference to the outcome of no biological children. 

I was diagnosed with endometriosis when I was 16. I knew there was a high chance having my own babies was going to be difficult. 

My current partner is super fertile. He has children from a previous marriage and we can get pregnant... I just can't keep hold of them. 
I've dragged all this baggage into my new relationship and it's toxic and awful and I wish that things were different. 

But he wants another baby too and he thought it would be easy (he didn't listen) and now this week we are going back to the fertility specialist. 
New partner. Same doctor. 
I'm obsessed again and it's not healthy but it's that one thing I want more than anything and I'll pump myself with drugs and do it all again. 

I am giving myself a limit though. Two more cycles and then a hysterectomy. Because then the decision is gone and I can perhaps start living my life again not obsessed with my own fertility and the pain of endo."

r/AskWomen,"Yep! I had a boyfriend whom I respected and thought very highly of. He told me he had been in love with the same girl for 9 years, and thought he had moved on enough from her to date someone new, but it turned out he hadn't. So, he couldn't keep dating me anymore when he was so hung up on her. I told him that sounded like a really tough place to be in, and that I was sorry he was hurting. He said he was sorry for not telling me sooner and that he enjoyed the time we did have. We both cried, we talked for a few hours, and then we wished each other well and went our separate ways. But we still talk about hockey sometimes (we bonded initially over hockey), and give each other occasional life updates, like he texted me when he got a dog and bought a house. It was my first boyfriend and honestly things ended remarkably well."
r/AskWomen,My bunch of my ancestors were murdered in the Salem witch trials. My one ancestor is actually sorta famous because of it! Her name was Mary Estey! She was one of the last killed in the Salem witch trials. She’s mentioned in The Conjuring movie & there’s a book with a whole chapter on her! (Can’t remember the book title off hand though).
r/AskWomen,"I can actually answer a specific question! Yay! 

Okay so my mom got a spinal cord injury due to medical malpractice when I was 13-14. We didn't know she had a it for a while because she had a tumor and the doctor fucked up the surgery but we didn't know until we revisited the MRIs a year or two later because she was getting worst and not better. At first it wasn't that bad but it got eventually worst, doctors told her she'd be paralyzed for life etc... 

My life has been very different since in a lot of ways. First of all, carrying a wheelchair has sort of become second nature to me. I also am more conscious about how disabled friendly places are and I get upset when people use disabled bathrooms to fuck or smoke cause um you can do that somewhere else, someone *needs* this bathroom. 

In terms of my own life, I schedule myself around my mom when I'm home. Every day I'll have to go with her to Starbucks and order her very unecessarily complicated order because she needs help getting in the car, carrying the wheelchair... I bring her to doctor appointments, physiotherapy, lunch, the supermarket, do her nails etc... my schedule is basically her schedule. 

In terms of my relationship with my mom well it's never been good tbh. This ""disability"" has made us weaker and stronger. It happened when I was so young that I really wasn't there for her much when she was in the hospital almost every week for a year ( I was 14). I regret it. Right now it's good and she appreciates everything I do for her but I do feel like my life is on hold for hers. She's also really sensitive to stress so anything I do that might bother her (that shouldn't) she'll make a big fuss about and say I'm making her worse, that always sucks lol. 

Oh also! Because she doesn't really trusts doctors she makes me take a bunch of supplements and makes me drink chlorophyll and stuff like that every day which I think is funny haha I don't need everything she gives me but I take it cause I know it'll make her happy. I'm also super conscious of my posture because of that too.

 I'm gonna be traveling alone with her soon for a month to this place specifically made for therapy to learn how to walk again. If I'm honest, I don't want to go... but I love her and I'll be there for her without complaint. 

TLDR: mom has a spinal cord injury and my life is basically scheduled around her needs"
r/AskWomen,Pizza and party mix - either Harry Potter or Marvel movies
r/AskWomen,"You remind yourself that you’re thinking of the idea of a person and not the person themselves. You can see a romanticised version of the future with you two in it, but you have to question how much you really know about that person and how compatible you truly are. You don’t know how they’ll react when you fall sick, you wouldn’t know what type of cereal to buy for them when you go shopping, you won’t know what they’re like after a stressful day. It’s easy to romanticise the idea of someone, but reminding yourself that you don’t know all of them  is important. Don’t ignore red flags either."
r/AskWomen,"Being DINKs (dual income no kids) is great. And I also love that I'm 26 and I'm still constantly discovering new things, learning new skills and having ""firsts"". Like I bought a house a few months ago and had plenty of firsts since like learning to garden or having my first pet."

I still get the urge to explore on my own and my SO understands completely. My life is pretty stressful and it's just an effective quick way for me to ""restart."" He also travels without me and I can't imagine keeping him from that. (When I've spoken of this, some people have no idea why he'd ""let"" me or trust me, but we're 100% secure and committed and that just reveals their own relationship anxieties.)"

Being divorced and not relying on him to do things has really made my life easier. Not saying divorce is the answer though haha."

I eventually realized he definitely didn’t actually love me and that he was selfish and manipulative. Lots of things happened that helped me to finally leave. I told a couple of friends and a sister, kind of told my parents but not specifically. I guess they told anyone else. It wasn’t a huge deal because nothing was planned and I never told most people why haha.

r/AskWomen,"Probably my best friend. It’s not all the time, only when she’s dating someone. She’s kind of neurotic when it comes to dating. She insists on telling me every single detail of every interaction she has with the guy and asks me for advice every step of the way. I love her to death, but it gets exhausting and I recently had to tell her that I can’t advise on her on *everything* and that she needs to work some of it out on her own."

r/AskWomen,"I'm tired of feeling miserable. I'm tired of feeling like I'm not quite at the edge where I want to kill myself and that I'm not feeling okay either. Everyday is a ""wake up, feel miserable, sit there"" type of mentality. Everyday is a ""that's who/where I want to be, but I hate myself too much to have those things and I will never get there"" type of struggle. My self-esteem stoops at the drop of a hat and I'm so sick of acting like I have it together in front of everyone. Living with my parents don't help either, my dad is an asshole and my mom is insensitive and in denial of her children's pain. They make me feel worse on top of how I already feel about myself, which was probably due to childhood trauma and how they raised me anyway. Please, tell me something that got better for your in your life, something where you didn't expect it to. I want hope. Thank you for letting me vent as well."
r/AskWomen,"They did nothing! I was a surprise baby after they had both retired (to be fair, they both retired much earlier than average). This meant that I had a TON of parental involvement in my life, PTA parents, driving me around, etc etc. Honestly it was pretty ideal as a child, a bit annoying as a teenager when I wanted more personal space, and it sucks now that I'm in my 20's. I started having serious talks with my parents about their wills, how they'd probably never meet my own children, and what to do after they passed away when I was 19, which ended up with me half-expecting them to die any day now even though they're both relatively healthy. So pros: got to be supermom and superdad. Cons: for a limited time only"
r/AskWomen,"Police/military. 

I’ve met some excellent people in the fields, but in my overall general experience most people who seek jobs that give them a position of authority or power have a complex about it, and we wouldn’t jive well.

I know it’s not everyone but it’s enough of a correlation for me to seek relationships with other people."

r/AskWomen,"So I have bipolar II (electric boogaloo). For those that don't know, this means more low mood times  and generally your high moods are not as extreme.

One way my moods have affected my relationships is that I am often very tired or sad when I hang out with people. It's nothing that they've done, it's just how it is. So a lot of the time, I am sitting in a corner at family events even though I'm happy to see everybody and I'm not fully enjoying myself. 

The way it's affected my relationship with my husband is that he never quite knows which wife he is coming home to: the chatty bubbly one, the sad hermited one, or the vibrating with anxiety one. Or a bit of each. And that can mean leaning on him too much and not giving him space. I'm working on it.

In terms of how it affects my life, I'd say it means trying ten times as hard to not be a burden on anyone. It means often hiding how I feel and how I'm doing to keep the peace. It means having to explain how I operate over and over again. It even means that I isolate myself a lot to avoid having my ""bad time"" ruin others. 

How has it improved? Well, medication and therapy have helped me maintain a pretty even baseline nowadays. The mood changes aren't as severe and I now know when they're more likely to occur. I'm much better at vocalizing when I need help and when I need to take care of myself.  For example, today I chose my support group over something else because I needed to vent."

-  let the cookie dough rest in the fridge at least overnight but a couple of days is fine. 

- take the cookies out of the oven when the edges are starting to turn brown but the top doesn't quite look done. Leave them on the cookie sheet for a few minutes and they'll continue to cook a bit (that's how you get the gooey. crispy effect, at least while they're still warm."

When my Finnish friend's British husband mentioned to her father and brothers that he wanted to marry her, it was when they were all out hunting in the woods for some male bonding time. His future in-laws decided to discuss what he had just said in front of him, in Finnish (a language he still doesn't speak because it's notoriously difficult for outsiders). So five men, who were all armed, when he was in a strange country, deep in the woods, were holding a secret conversation about him. Apparently that was one of the most terrifying moments of his life and he regrets not asking them while gardening or something much safer. 

It all worked out alright in the end though, and at the wedding her brothers told me that they really liked him but just decided to discuss the weather in angry tones to mess with him."

r/AskWomen,"my sister found out she was pregnant while dating her now husband. my mom is very religious/traditional and kind of pressured them into getting married before her baby was born. i'm sure they would have eventually, but my sister didn't want her then bf to feel forced into anything since they hadn't been together too long. the only place that was available was a local prison .. it was quite dreary to be honest haha. [i still cried.] none of his family were there; i'm not sure they even knew he'd been dating my sister. she looked beautiful in her dress; her stomach remained relatively small throughout the pregnancy .. i don't think she needed to buy new clothes. they had a proper ceremony a couple of years after she gave birth."
r/AskWomen,"I realized that my clinging to the idea of “not being like other girls” was because I was threatened by other women, seeing them as competition that I failed to live up to, and so reacting by trying to set myself apart as different and thus “better.”

From there, I realized that it was my attitude and low self-esteem that was negatively impacting my relationships with and perceptions of women. I realized women weren’t my competition, but rather a diverse and wonderful array of people who all had their own gifts to offer, and that we were all more alike than different. 

It had a hugely positive shift on my life. I started developing more and stronger female friendships, relating better to women, and finding happiness and solidarity in the experiences that bind us rather than clinging to things that set me apart. I started prioritizing supporting women over trying to curry favour with men. I became a lot happier, a lot less judgmental and negative, and frankly just a better person."
r/AskWomen,"I saw a man comment a womans instagram yesterday. It was a workout instagram, and he commented something like ""I wanna lick that sweaty ass!"" and I just went :O and then started wondering how the hell he thought that would have worked out. Like, seriously? Which person would be turned on by that?

And this is something I see veeeeeeeeery often on instagram posts. Just a bunch of really disgusting men who post really disgusting shit, and think that it is okay, that that is how they should talk to people they don't know and never met. It's mind boggling to me."

r/AskWomen,"I work in tech, but still have advice that I think applies anywhere.

First and foremost, I get my shit done. I learn quickly, pay close attention, meet deadlines, and memorize details so people will know how much I care about the work I do. I also ask for help when I need it and admit that I'm wrong, so people know they can trust me when I do things right. If possible, I follow up mistakes with solutions. All in all, I really prioritize my career, and I would consider myself successful and a hard worker.

When sexism does get to me, most of the time, I plow through it. Meet ridiculous behavior with sarcasm, especially in large groups. My teacher announced to my all-male class that be felt bad for me in such a ""boys club."" I told him, ""Yeah, it's real scary outside the kitchen,"" which got riotous laughter from the class. Every day at work is more of that- sarcasm is your friend.

I work with a lot of men, and as weird as it sounds, a lot of those men seem to have little social experience with women. They get uncomfortable around me, so I just try to be direct and friendly. If they're still taking shots at me, they're getting shots back. And IMO jokes aren't always bad- it's when someone starts treating you w kid gloves that it indicates you're doing something wrong."
r/AskWomen,"I was recently at a makeup masterclass with St John (Beyoncé’s makeup artist), and these were the 3 points he wanted everyone to remember the most:

1. Don’t follow the hype from influencers. Most of them lie because they’re being paid. Pay attention to your skin and how it behaves; only you will know what feels right and what doesn’t. 

2. Baking and waterproof mascara are bad ideas. Baking dries the hell out of your undereye area and quickens aging. Waterproof mascara dries your eyelashes and can make them more brittle. 

3. Effort for makeup = effort for skincare. So many people pile on the makeup, but do the absolute minimum for their skincare routine. The more makeup you use, the more attention needs to be paid to your skin as it’s the foundation for a great face. Doesn’t mean a lot of products necessarily, but you need to put in the work your skin truly requires. 

He also said sunscreen, but that shouldn’t be a tip and more a natural action everyone does. Also, more expensive doesn’t mean better. Focus on how your skin reacts and forget what everyone else says."

r/AskWomen,"A gut feeling is more sudden and it makes me think about whatever caused it to validate the gut feeling decision. It probably lasts a minute or two.
Overthinking is when I never had a sudden feeling but instead, thinking about it and trying to see it from different angles and such until I make a decision. This might last for a few minutes to more than a day.  

I hope that's not confusing"
r/AskWomen,"I made that mistake a few times when asked politely by someone who seemed very nice. No, thanks. In my experience, it is always a gateway for them to try to lawyer you into dating them or they get angry because they disagree with you. Besides, just because you aren't compatible with me doesn't mean you need to change. You might be totally compatible with someone else."

r/AskWomen,"No but I have noticed a strategy at work where people are borderline 'office acceptable' flirtatious with others to sweet talk them into taking on more work, working harder, working longer hours... it's a narc strategy executed by a lot of people in power.

r/AskWomen,"I'll give you the flip answer, my husband had to wait for me. Long story short in high school we were good friends and for a short while FWB. Didn't work out and we lost contact after we graduated. That fall I started dating someone new and we were together for 3 and a half years. About 2 weeks after we broke up, I ran into my high school FWB and we hit it off, but I wasn't ready for a new relationship so soon. He made it clear he would be willing to wait for me and he would be as close or as distant as I wanted. We hooked up a few times and hung out all the time but it took me about 2 months of that to be mentally prepared to be in a relationship. We've now been together almost 7 years and married 1!"

r/AskWomen,The other day. We were chatting at work about old hobbies we miss doing. I mentioned that before an accident I had I used to do ballet. My supervisor was taken back by it and said that he couldn't ever imagine me doing ballet because I'm such a big girl and ballet isn't for fat girls.

r/AskWomen,"I grew up with a very, very non-sensitive mom and a sensitive dad. My dad always accepted me and my sensitivity, but my mom always denigrated it. I felt a lot of shame and defensiveness up until I was in college for being a sensitive person, but I finally decide I was both sensitive *and* strong and that they didn’t cancel each other out.

I first started showing signs as a kid. When I was 6 years old, we were watching a movie in class about how pollution and littering hurts ocean animals. In the movie, a sea turtle puppet got caught in plastic and was injured, and I started crying. Nobody else was crying, so I was pretty embarrassed. This just continued- I would have to hold back tears when watching Holocaust movies in 8th grade or learning about slavery. I was always terrified someone would catch me crying, because it really embarrassed me. My mom taught me that the fact that I cried easily was shameful and embarrassing, so I really tried to hold it back. 

I have pretty severe anxiety and some OCD, but over the years they’ve gotten better. Accepting my own sensitivity and not trying to fight it has decreased my anxiety a lot. I used to be so embarrassed to be a sensitive person, but now I view it as a mostly positive trait in myself. I’m glad that I’m moved by other people’s suffering, as it’s what made me want to study pharmaceutical science and help people."

r/AskWomen,"Customer service is emotionally exhausting.  I'm not one of those people who hate all customers on principle--most of the people I interact with are perfectly normal, kind, and polite, and I find plenty to be genuinely cool and interesting--but it's so tiring trying to make dozens or hundreds of people all feel special in a single day, back to back.  If I don't have any energy left to smile brightly at you, I promise it's not because I don't like you.  You're great, probably.  That particular emotional muscle just happens to need a rest when you walk up.  

And I feel like this is something that gets left out of conversations about emotional labor.  I don't know if it's because *paid* labor seems like too obvious of a thing to address, but emotional labor is more than just the things that happen in the domestic realm.  I don't have any stats on me, but it certainly seems like women are more likely to have *paid* customer facing jobs that rely heavily on emotional labor.  Cashiers, servers, nurses, teachers, receptionists, bank tellers, and probably plenty more I'm not thinking of at the moment are all jobs that *necessarily require* you to put on a happy face and bury whatever you're actually feeling for someone else's benefit.  That's an incredibly exhausting thing to do, even moreso when you know that your rent is riding on you being able to keep up the performance while the customer will forget the interaction within seconds of walking out the door, and it's almost always the *least* appreciated part of that job.  Especially for women, since it's taken for granted that we just naturally prioritize making other people happy no matter what going on in our own lives.

So yeah, that's been on my mind for quite some time now.  Thanks for the opportunity to voice it.  I started to add a smiling emoji, but I'm feeling too tired for even that little bit of faux cheerfulness, so 😐.  Nothing personal, you're great, probably."
r/AskWomen,"This was back in the Navy.  I was on a ship and out to sea and I was standing watch at the Electric Panel(a big panel full of dials and switches and gauges) and noticed one of the gauges was not reading what I thought it should read.  So, I figured the needle was stuck.

Not a big deal, it is normally just a bit of static cling holding it in place and only takes a tap to loosen it.  I reached up and tapped it with a finger.

It stayed out of place.  I tapped it again and threw in a glare for good measure.

The stubborn thing refused my gentle corrections.

I was not going to take that kind of sass from this dumb, mindless object, so I stood on my chairs footrest and leaned forward to thump the metal casing next to the damned thing.

Unfortunately, my day got much worse when we took the slightest of rolls and my chair moved in the wrong direction and I just punched this gauge right in the face.  The plastic shattered as soon as I did it and I heard ""Oh, fuckfuckfuck"".

Which I quickly realized was me saying that and everyone was staring at me.

I broke a gauge worth several times over my salary and we would need to get a new one out to use.  While underway.  At sea.  On alert patrol.

I was in some shit for that for a while."
r/AskWomen,"Not so much a pink tax, but I was at the San Francisco Razr store two weeks ago.  All of their laptops had the prices, the type of graphics power, SSD/HD sizes, etc.  All of them except for the pink Quartz collection, which only had prices listed.  I know that the pink color is the draw of the collection, but it was shitty to hide the specs, as if women wouldn’t understand or care."
r/AskWomen,"Mine is seeing bugs in the home. Outside? No problem - it's all yours buddy. But the moment I see any bugs/insects in my bedroom, I panic and I can spend up to a month living in fear of these things. This is when my accompanying OCD kicks in with the constant checking of these things behind my bed or in my bathroom. The fear of them is so paralyzing and it's all I can think about when I'm work. The thought of them multiplying, infesting, making me lose control of things, the thought of my bed no longer being a sanctuary for me - is too much for me to take. 

I finally started seeing a therapist for it, after dealing with every year (with always a different type of bug/insect), for the last 5 years. I'm starting CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) soon which I hope will help me manage this phobia a lot better because I know I WILL see bugs again in the future. That can't be helped but it can be kept in check."

r/AskWomen,"Back when I still had a dating app, I had over 12345 likes over the course of a few months (Yes, I took a screenshot of the number because I found it funny, that's how I still know). The guys who swiped right on there were really a colorful mix. Creeps, a few reeaaally hot ones, nerds, musicians, some that were absolutely not my type...

In real life, I barely get hit on, ever. If it happens it's mostly a joke by customers at the bar. The few who weren't joking recently were either older than my dad, morbidly obese, fucking creeps or all of the above. By creeps I mean they were trying to get me drunk or were very handsy after like 2-3 minutes."
r/AskWomen,"I got big ones. GG cup size. I have to hold them going down stairs. I have to move them to a comfortable place when I lie down. My dog loves to lie on them and contrary to popular belief they are not pillows they have actual nerves inside of them that scream when they are squished. I can't wear shirts. Going outside a lot of people give me judgy stares cause they bounce. When I try to get past people they usually brush against them which is the most awkward thing. I have to be careful washing them.

It's so comfortable, looks great, you can roll up the sleeves and/or cinch the waist with a cute belt to make it look a bit different, it has pockets.  I can wear it with bare legs and flats or sandals in the summer, and with tights and boots and maybe a cardigan in the winter.  So versatile."
r/AskWomen,"Mine came when I was nearly 17. I'd had a large chest by the time I was 9 so I had all but convinced myself that I was not going to get my period. I was shocked and horrified when it came.

As for if there is any variation, I've never heard of it, but I do have a very regular (down to the hour) and veryyyyy light period. It starts in the evening, done by the next afternoon, sometimes followed by brown spotting for a day afterwards. It's so light I do nothing for it until the morning, and I only need a single tampon per period. I do use panty liners for both days. 

I didn't know I was an outlier in that way until my midtwenties. I've never personally spoken to someone who got it as late as I did, so I've never drawn a correlation between that and how light it is."

He mustve sent me 8 or 9 creepy messages in a row without response before i was like ""should i dive into this? Nahhhh"" amd blocked his number. It wasn't until a week later that i checked facebook and realized that i hadn't unfriended him, and he had posted *eleven* vaguebook statuses about ""women who can't commit,"" ""women who can't handle strong men,"" ""why does everyone leave me,"" and more. was_locked"
r/AskWomen,"Obgyn here, for what it's worth :) 

A lot of women do gain a modest amount of weight in the beginning, but it tends to level out after a little while. If you think about it, most adults have cycles of weight gain and loss over time (how many women at 30 weigh the same as they did in high school?). Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the reason, too. Many women start birth control around the same time they begin college, which is also when they tend to eat out more, drink more, etc. So there are a lot of external factors that could come into play. 

It's interesting because most studies fail to find a statistically significant correlation between hormonal contraceptives and weight gain, yet most women would beg to differ. But keep in mind that 5 pounds may not be considered ""statistically significant"" in a clinical study, but for many women, it absolutely is, esp when the only difference in lifestyle is the bc.

It's the most common reason I see women go off their bc, but I always tell my patients to wait it out for a few months and see if it levels off. Many hormonal contraceptives absolutely do cause bloating and water retention, which can result in a jump in the scale and tighter fitting clothing. At the end of the day, though, you know your body better than anyone. Your obgyn can help you find a contraceptive that works for you."
r/AskWomen,"Get tired of your own shit. That’s how I did it. I was sick of people fucking me over and taking advantage of me, then one day it hit me like a truck. People don’t fuck me over and take advantage of me because they’re terrible people (even though that’s still true), they do it because I let them. Ever since then I’ve been getting better at boundaries, even though it’s uncomfortable because I feel bad not letting people do what they want. 

I mean the thing is, I can tell you all of these words, but it’s up to you to practice what *you* need to practice to set boundaries. Maybe you’re a foot-down style. Maybe you’re like me and make it crafty to not seem like a jerk (pro-tip: still not the healthiest - that practice takes a significant amount of emotional labour, but still gets the point across). Maybe you strike that perfect balance in between. 

The first step really is to know that you deserve to have boundaries.

**Edit:** I just saw your comment. In my experience, people want you to set boundaries. I had a friend who lets people walk all over her constantly, and I bluntly told her to put boundaries up between to us, and to tell me “no” when she didn’t want to go out and do something on a particular day. When I set my own boundaries, it actually improves my relationships because I’m telling other people how *I* want to be treated. And therefore no undue resentments are being built :P

Seriously, boundary-setting doesn’t have to be as dramatic as one might think. Sometimes it’s as simple as saying in a matter-of-fact way “Can you not do x, y, z? Please understand that I feel a, b, c about it.” And people get it. The good ones are like “Oh shoot, I didn’t know - thanks for the heads up” and all that."
r/AskWomen,"There was a myth growing up that after Hurricane Andrew hit, in order to keep the tourist industry afloat the official death count was kept low (only like 15 people officially died in Florida from the hurricane), with the other deaths being chalked up to indirect reasons, or that they were classified as other deaths (drug overdoses etc), missing people, or simply moved away. The most extreme theory was dead bodies were hidden in Burger King refrigerated trucks.

I still believe that to be true, that the state artificially kept the # low because saying 2000 people died because Florida didn't have their shit together is a terrible look (this is before it became a state-turned-meme).  Not the Burger King thing"
r/AskWomen,“Leave your fucking eyebrows alone!”
r/AskWomen,"My mum loves cosmetic tattoos as she's not the type to like to do her makeup. She's had her brows, eyeliner and lips tattooed and needs to get them touched up every now and then. She thinks it's worth it and claims it's relatively pain free. I personally wouldn't mess with anything on my face but I also like wearing makeup so we have different needs. She also did them overseas as it was cheaper (primary reason she was there was to get dental work done because her dentist  told her to go overseas as it would be ridiculously expensive if she did it locally). Happy to ask her questions, if you have any specific ones!"

r/AskWomen,I bunch of crap I should probably sort through. It’s a junk drawer
r/AskWomen,How tiny I am
r/AskWomen,"I had a guy friend for a few years. We got along really well and I thought he was just a genuinely nice guy. Problem was, he had a girlfriend. I was single when we first met and *praying* he would say he was single too, but he didn't, he told me about his girlfriend. Two years go by and we're still friends. I tried to let my feelings for him go because he was obviously in a committed relationship and wasn't interested in me. Well, things went south in his relationship when the girl hardcore cheated on him, like with multiple guys he was friends with, in his bed, while he was away for work to support her. About a year after he found out, he confessed that he had been in love with me the whole time, since we first met. I was afraid of jumping into a relationship with him and getting hurt, but I took a leap of faith.

He's asleep next to me right now and we're celebrating our first anniversary on Saturday. Don't give up hope."
r/AskWomen,My wife's mental health
r/AskWomen,"As someone who became manipulative and borderline emotionally abusive during a really dark period, I think it all depends on the person's understanding of what they've done and their dedication to changing. I did not know I was abusing my partner when I did it, because I was too depressed to have any perspective. As soon as I realized what my behavior was doing to him, I was appalled and ashamed, and I was determined to stop. I apologized to him in a way that showed I knew the severity of what I'd been doing, and I made a conscious effort every day never to use guilt as a weapon again.

I think if there's any attempt to justify the behavior, if there's any repeated abuse after it's been recognized as abuse, then there are no second chances. Get the fuck out. And even if it *is* handled well, you still have every right to get the fuck out. But if there's reason to believe the person truly did not intend to hurt you and will make a conscious decision never to do so again, then I think there's room for a second chance if you're inclined to give it. Sometimes people do change."
r/AskWomen,When I had contact with my exes I was just lonely. I didn’t want to deal with myself or face my problems so I got lost in someone else even if just for a bit. It was a super unhealthy cycle.
r/AskWomen,"My boyfriend doesn’t do really well with big crowds and lots of people, but I thrive in those kinds of environments. Our compromise at social events is I handle all the talking while he raids the complimentary food table and snags the good stuff for us. Teamwork makes the dream work."
r/AskWomen,"In my family I’m the only girl grandchild. I have 2 male cousins on both sides and I was always around them so when I was younger I love me sports, toy guns, action man, hot wheels, etc. I don’t have a good relationship with my mother, my aunties (parents sisters) aren’t close with my parents, and my grandmothers died when I was young. My dad and I are very close. I was in sports from as young as I can remember and have been my whole life. My coaches, teachers, friends, were all male. I hate pink/purple, anything feminine is basically a no go. I didn’t wear a dress until I was 19 and that was only because I went to a wedding 

I can safely say it’s been shit so far. I have been bullied all my life because I didn’t know any better. Basically the most masculine straight girl you’d ever come across lol. I was dedicated to sports and being “jacked” was something I had to be for my sport. I’m now learning how to be a “woman”. I feel ugly as fuck (because I am). I have no idea what to wear to make myself feel comfortable, yet people not look at me like I’m a weirdo. In college I was told by my teammates “well we defs thought you were a lesbian”. You know when you’re self conscious af and someone picks up on that one thing... yeah, that was that one thing. I’m now in the midst of pushing myself to buy pinks and purples, and lord knows whatever else is feminine (even if I don’t like it) because I’m so scared people judge me 

My husband bought me some black trainers/tennis shoes/whatever you call them, for Christmas. I loved them. I took them back and exchanged them for the exact same pair in a weird pink color that seems to be the thing at the moment, just to look more feminine 

How has it shaped me? Shaped me into anxiety and fear. Thank you society"
r/AskWomen,"As an anxious person who cries even when they're angry I can understand this problem. I have been dealing with a somewhat rude superior at work. Recently that had been very hard for me bc I am vying for a fulltime position where I get paid a living wage. 

In our discussions even if I feel angry, worried, or anxious I do not let my mind spiral to a place that would lead me to break down. To ensure I do not break down in front of others I try to speak slowly and strongly. I think through what I'm saying before I say it. And above all else I take nothing personally. This is very hard but I believe that is the key to not breaking down in difficult conversations."
r/AskWomen,"I danced for 5 years when I was younger. I wish I never stopped, but I wanted to cheer instead and my mom let me make that decision. 

I was thinking about that today actually. I was dancing around in the kitchen and I thought about looking for an adult dance class. 

You should do it! If they offer it in your area it could be so much fun. It’s not always about making something out of it, it’s just something to do and it really is a great time."
r/AskWomen,My mother has always criticized me growing up but I don’t think it’s her intention...I just think that’s how she was brought up and doesn’t know how to get her point across any other way. I’ve accepted that that’s how she is and she will never change. It’s also the main reason we’ve never had a close relationship and the reason why I treat my teenage daughter so differently than how I was raised.
r/AskWomen,I started working out. I started to focus on what my body could do more than how it looked.
r/AskWomen,"I’m a heavily tattooed woman. I don’t get any shit for it, honestly, and that includes when I am in even very conservative areas. Once in a very, very rare blue moon some old guy will make an awkward and sort of rude comment, but it rarely happens. 

That said, I do cover my arms when going into certain professional situations where I don’t know the vibe, for instance when the folks I’ll be interacting with are more conservative and I don’t know how they’d react. If I get to know them better I won’t bother. It’s not a big deal though, just a matter of judging what’s appropriate or likely to make the best impression for a situation. 

The one thing I will say is that (at least if you’re straight) having lots of visible tattoos definitely narrows your dating pool — even if they won’t say it to your face, a lot of guys don’t like it. 

However, for me that’s fine because I’m really only interested in guys who are also into tattoos and tend to be more attracted to women with tattoos, and the type of guys who are turned off by them are without exception guys I wouldn’t be interested in dating anyway. So it all works out for the best.

Also, some professional fields would still not look too kindly on it, so depending on what you do keep that in mind in case you need to plan to cover up accordingly."
r/AskWomen,"In my 20s my boobs were best friends. They hung out together, barely needed support, just close snuggle buddies that made any shirt look amazing

Now that I'm closer to 40, my boobs have decided that they hate each other. They're also shy and stare at the floor or fall into my armpits. I need to jam them into their get along bra to keep them from smacking into each other all day. On the plus side though, they're bigger, and with the right bra I can get some really rockin cleavage that my 20 year old self with sigh over

I also have some pretty significant lines going around my mouth and eyes. And I strongly suspect that I'm going to be one of those women who gets jowly."
r/AskWomen,"It helped me to learn about attachment styles (anxious, avoidant, secure) and the theory behind that. From experience, I know that certain people would be bad SOs for me because they would aggravate my issues, while others are actually helpful because they offer a lot of reassurance. Just know that you'll probably have initial emotional reactions to fears of abandonment throughout your life. It's perfectly fine; it served an evolutionary purpose. The more aware you are of when these feelings come up, the more you can take a step back, name the feeling for what it is, and then decide if you want to indulge it or walk away from it. I recommend dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)."
r/AskWomen,Endlessly amazing! Even with the language gap it was easy to get around. I very much ate my way through that country and got engaged on the top of Mount Fuji!
r/AskWomen,I had customers verbally harass me regularly and my managers did nothing about it. I'm white and some people would come up to me and start making racist remarks about my coworkers. I've had drunk men make endless sexual comments in front of their wives. When you work in customer service people treat you like human garbage.
r/AskWomen,"Got my manuscript published, after 3 rejections and after 5 rounds of revisions, you heard right_ five rounds!!"
r/AskWomen,"I moved to another country. It is one of the best thing that happened to me. My mum is quite sad, but I don't really care. I am not super family oriented person, so i like seeing them only once or twice a year"
r/AskWomen,"Ask if there is anything you can do, and listen to the answer. Like when anyone is hurting."
r/AskWomen,"21, I had a huge life-altering moment of realization (after an intense acid trip) that I was doing NOTHING for myself and only doing things for others. I realized a lot of my toxic behaviors were a direct result of my insecurities and self doubt/hate. From that day on I committed to being healthy (workin out, eating right, sleeping enough.) I also committed to ending relationships that weren’t good for me. I left my boyfriend of 3 years. I started meditating, reading more, doing more art, and focusing on the career I love. A year later, I found the love of my life. I’m a firm believer that your “one” will come when your heart and soul are already full."
r/AskWomen,"I was at my lowest a couple of months ago, I was unemployed for 2 months, something I have never been before as I have always been in work. I just kept telling myself something will turn up and this time next year I can look back and say I got through it cause it was such a hard time. I have a job now and i am getting back on my feet but just remember whatever it is, it won’t last forever and you will get where you need to be"
r/AskWomen,"When she had her first stroke and was in the hospital, I stayed there with her for a few days. It was sort of like we were having a sleepover tbh. 

No one else seemed to see it at the time, but I had this gut feeling that it was the beginning of the end. Medically, it all sounded very promising. She was supposed to have a full recovery pretty quickly. But it wasn’t long before she had another stroke, then she started having seizures... I’m so glad I spent that time with her at the hospital when she was still doing so well emotionally."
r/AskWomen,"I started in a labor intensive job, tried white collar for a few years, and went back to the more physical job. Sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day crushed my soul. I will moan and complain when my body hurts after a grueling day, but it just makes me feel more alive."
r/AskWomen,"Never did studying or homework at home. I would only do it at the library. It would create extra incentive to get the work done so I could go home, and I could fully relax at home knowing I was done for the day. Also soylent, stress would make me lose my appetite and I rarely had time to prepare meals, so soylent was the solution I came up with for both those problems."
r/AskWomen,"Brave, takes shit from no one, assertive, confident, self assured, competent. So, my mom, basically. She's amazing :D"
r/AskWomen,When they start screaming and then I nope tf out of there. Idk if I'd be a good mom or not. I feel like I don't have the patience for the screaming/crying to deal with children at this point in my life.
r/AskWomen,"About 8 months. It really really sucked. It wasn’t super heavy, but it just didn’t stop. I was on the pill at the time and even took extra progesterone to try to stop it, but it carried on gently for months and then stopped. No wonder I ended up anaemic. My doctor never did figure out what caused it either, even after all manner of tests."
r/AskWomen,"My first serious relationship I believed that “relationships take work” which is true and fine, but I was doing ALL the work. Never again."
r/AskWomen,"Big red flag for me personally as preferences that exclude entire social groups often have a root in some form of bias and preferences that specify a race can be fetish-y. To me a preferred is, ""I like nice teeth"" not ""I only like Asian women because [stereotype]."""
r/AskWomen,The passing of my parents and my SO.
r/AskWomen,Total? Ten years. Six until I got up the courage and then was rejected. Four getting strung along with hints he might change his mind. Finally accepted that that just wasn’t going to happen and forced myself to move on.
r/AskWomen,"if i'm personally THAT upset about something in a brand spanking new relationship, i take a moment to realize the gravity of that. 

assuming i'm not being hormonal or unreasonable because of my own stuff (it lasting more than a day or so or recurring is a good barometer for me), the beginning of a relationship is the *best it will ever be*. if we're already fighting or i'm noticing serious things wrong... that does not bode well.

personally, i see little merit in sitting a person down and having this super serious discussion of problems in the relationship if the relationship *itself* isn't super serious yet. i'd be more likely to wonder if it's a glaring incompatibility and a sign to not go forward."
r/AskWomen,Would not jive. I need words of confirmation.
r/AskWomen,"Lizzo's entire catalogue is A+ for remembering you're a bad ass lady who needs no one but herself. ""Soulmate"" and ""Good as Hell"" are my two faves for this purpose."
r/AskWomen,"I had like 1000 word essay written but I deleted it. I went through a period of this personally, and am just coming out of it. It’s been 12 years and so sometimes life goes off the rails a bit and for a while I felt like we were two friends just living together but not living life together and he faded into the background of my own life. I stopped being interested in him, and the more I pulled away. The more freedom I had. And I was resenting it. I thought he didn’t want me. And I stopped wanting him. And that went on for probably almost a year. 

And I had plenty opportunities to stray. I didn’t. But I had to think it through. Was this just the slow decline to the end? Maybe. But if it was... it wasn’t going to be my fault. So I devised a plan. I was going to give myself six months where I was going to try 1000x more than before. And if I felt the same then I guess it was time. 

I started by being kind about him in public. I would talk about only nice things that he did. Almost a fake it till you make it. Because I was talking about him, I got to see how the world saw him. They would talk about how amazing my kid was doing at x event or how he was proud of how hard I was working. I stopped complaining to my friends and instead would talk to him. I took up cooking, in an artsy sense and would play and make messes in the kitchen. Then he would rave about it and clean the entire thing up. I would say something nice once in a while and he would just come back and be like, “I think about you all day”

And then I would bring up the things that disenchanted me.  Him being negative every time he came home. Him making fun of the TV shows and stuff I liked, or liked to do. So what if I am rereading twilight for the 12th time or have Harry Potter drinking games with my friends. It’s me. And when you make fun of that, it hurts. It makes me not like you. 

I kind of realized I let years go by where I let years go by where instead of me just going, “please don’t” I never told him that it bugs me. But it coloured my opinion. And the funny thing is he loves that I’m a dork and can recite the first Harry Potter movie off my heart, and always thought that the fact I let shit roll off my shoulders was a sign of how strong and genuine of a person I am. The truth is I just sheltered it for years, from my best friend and lifemate. 

Oh. I guess I wrote an essay again. I guess the TLDR is: be honest, be kind. Try not to shit talk to your friends too much. And if he’s a good man, give yourself some time, clarity and the college try. It may fall back into place."
r/AskWomen,"It hasn't happened a lot recently but having had very large breasts for all my life, I can remember several times when women would make inappropriate comments or even just reach out and squeeze or jiggle my breasts around. Some women think that just because they're women it's not harassment? I tried to always be a good sport about it but I always found it irritating and extremely embarrassing."
r/AskWomen,"I like learning new languages (or trying to at least) so I've joined some international forums and apps to try to meet new people and practice my language skills! I also love cooking different cuisines and baking but I'm terrible at baking. Once, I tried baking a carrot cake with frosting but the frosting ended up with a gritty texture and a brown hue!"
r/AskWomen,"This doesn’t necessarily cost money...But the thing that saves me the most time in the morning is showering at night! And having a go-to air-dried hair style, for days when I’m really short on time. 

I don’t have to wash my body or my face in the morning and my hair just needs to be soaked then styled if I washed it the night before, or touched up if not. Another key to this is sleeping in a satin bonnet or with satin pillow cases if your hair is naturally curly or wavy, because you can’t just comb it out and go like with straight hair."
r/AskWomen,"There was this blanket and backpack I really wanted, with these bunny ears on it! I figured, hey, look, it's for kids. Let me ask mom. She said no, told me it wasn't appropriate but never told me *why*. It was the playboy logo."
r/AskWomen,"I start every relationship with this understanding, even my current one and it’s been 6 years now. I don’t believe in “forever” but in living and loving in the here and now cuz it’s more romantic but also realistic. People grow. People die. All things come to an end someday."

r/AskWomen,"My parents weren't comfortable with me alone in a locked room with my S/O until I married him. We lived together for 4 years and still had to sleep in separate rooms while visiting my parents.

If they came to visit me, they had to deal with the fact that S/O and I shared a room. It was our house.

I don't have kids, but I'd be disturbed if my cats locked the door  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ was_locked"
r/AskWomen,"This is me sort of - three sisters raised mainly by mom my cause my dad traveled Sun-Sat and would mostly just nap when home or go drinking with his buddies. Add in all girls high school...

&#x200B;

One of the biggest negatives I have noticed is that I have a hard time recognizing that men have certain emotions. That might sound a little crazy...but society's portrayal of men being strong, never showing emotions, never really being affected by anything is how I've always viewed them. That's all I ever got to experience until I made better guy friends in college. I can't quite think of any examples but hopefully that makes sense."
r/AskWomen,"I grew up in Alabama and spent some summers in Mississippi. Also went to Bama for college. I don’t like it. But I also don’t like people who aren’t from there shitting on it, because they rarely know what they’re talking about beyond stereotypes, and also often think they’re exempt from racism. I live in DC now, so I'm close to Virginia (and technically under the Mason-Dixon line, but by no means a Southern city, in my opinion) and not terribly far from the South. This is much more my speed."
r/AskWomen,"not many details in your post but ill answer: just be selfish. do things for yourself, dye your hair, beauty yourself up, enjoy activities with or without a friend, etc. but before that, if you're in a really bad place, clean yourself up and straighten your life out (like shower, get a job, go to school) take care of the basic life stuff first, then go on to do more things. i wish you gl :)"
r/AskWomen,"I spent time alone.

I hated being alone, but it allowed me to with through my emotions to figure out what was bothering me. I was in an a you’ve relationship for years and I was down in myself for letting myself get treated so poorly. Took a lot of small & big steps in self care to make myself feel more confident.

I started a skin care routine, applied for college, moved on my own (have a roommate but I’d only ever lived with boyfriends), have been trying to stop drinking. Small & big things day by day will help you."
r/AskWomen,"That depends entirely on a person's income, priorities and other spending. I think of make up as a luxury item so imo reasonable would be whatever money you had left over after paying the bills, necessary expenses, putting away money into savings and retirement and investments i.e. disposable income."
r/AskWomen,"I'm 5'9 so that qualifies as tall*ish* but not abnormally tall, yet I'll press on and answer anyway. I have been asked to reach for a lot of things in my time but I've always been glad to help and a little amused by the requests, so that isn't too bad.

The main drawback, I've found, is that in school/club photos, you're always placed in the back, so if you have on a rockin' outfit, it's mostly obscured. Grrrreat."

r/AskWomen,"I do a lot of the other things mentioned here but one of the more unusual ones I do, is I don't buy fast fashion clothes and I repair everything I have until it's ready to fall apart. Most fast fashion stuff isn't made sturdily enough to take multiple repairs. Buying better made clothes, occasionally from thrift stores, sometimes new let's me get away with buying clothes so much less often. Which uses less plastic for polyester, less water and pesticides for cotton and so on."
r/AskWomen,I'm constructing elaborate day dreams to try and trick myself into slipping into real dreams.  It's about 65% successful

r/AskWomen,"Sometimes the right person isn’t at the right time. Be thankful for your relationship and what it taught you. 

Time for a social media hiatus or at least block them in every platform. Distract yourself with something consuming - a new hobby, volunteer, start taking a night class, thrift shop for new clothes, anything to fill your time so you don’t wallow. Lots of people go to the gym because it’s relatively inexpensive and time consuming plus makes you feel good.

Good luck. Wishing you the best, breakups can be hard."

I was the one who initiated and determined how fast the relationship progressed so that I was comfortable and felt I had control. I was confident before I met him, but not in relationships so that helped build that type of confidence and communication. He was comfortable with this and I think it was nice for him to be the one who didn't have to lead, he seemed to be ready to do things before me. But was happy to wait so I was as ready as he was. Now it is even and we communicate regularly (when we go out on dates) how we feel about our relationship and the future and past."
r/AskWomen,"Not everyone you love is going to love you. That isn't your fault, but it isn't their fault either. 

No matter how stable or ""sane"" I may feel in a moment, week, or month. I am sick, and I will eventually crash back down into the anxiety. I have to continue working on myself, probably forever and that's okay."
r/AskWomen,"I tell myself that If it takes less than five minutes to complete, do it. No excuses. Dishes in the sink? 2 minutes. That usually leads me to cleaning everything in close proximity! Wipe the sink down after dishes. Then counter and so on. It’s kind of a snow ball effect"
r/AskWomen,Sahara desert at night .
r/AskWomen,I'm almost 38 and some of today's teenagers are extremely remarkable. For example watching the Parkland survivors rally and speak with such wisdom gave me hope.
r/AskWomen,"I kinda don't. Time is an abstract concept to me that I can't really apply a visualization to.

When I think of the future in particular it sorta doesn't exist? Like I have a difficult time thinking of things that will be happening six months from now. I basically assume they won't happen. Not in some fatalistic ""we'll all be dead"" way, but in an abstract ""that doesn't exist yet"" way. This applies to a lesser degree with things happening within the next several days or weeks, and even to some degree within the next few hours. 

I get excited about things that are coming up and have an understanding of how long the time will take and all that, but time as a thing is really abstract to me.

I'm not really sure how to describe it."
r/AskWomen,Arguing with people over the internet. Not worth the trouble.
r/AskWomen,"Although I’m not a single mother myself, I’ll offer my perspective as the child of a single mother:

My mom was 18 when I was born and 24 when my twin siblings were born. My dad was and still to this day is a total deadbeat. Never finished high school. Never able to hold down a job. Was addicted to online gambling. Was, generally, an asshole. 

People were *very* outspoken about my mom’s decisions. At the time, I was angry about this and couldn’t understand why people were so “mean” to my mom. But now, as an adult, I understand completely. 

My grandmother often times had to step in to help out financially. When my mom couldn’t afford to pay rent, my grandfather had to take us in and let us live with him for 5 years. Other family members were often guilt tripped into babysitting, for free, because my mom was always working or going to school. 

People weren’t being “mean” to my mom like I thought they were. My mom’s poor decisions, that lead to her having *three* children before she was 25 with a useless partner, affected not only herself but *everyone around her*. They were angry/frustrated because my mom kept having kids that she couldn’t afford, with a guy who she knew wouldn’t step up. 

From my experiences personally and from what I’ve seen with other families, people don’t hate on “single moms”. There are plenty of women who raise families alone and succeed greatly. People hate on women who have children that they can’t afford and then expect their friends/family to help them. And honestly, I feel that."
r/AskWomen,Stand By Me. So much nostalgia and such a great cast. It reminds me of my childhood.
r/AskWomen," 

I was talking with a colleague the other day, and I used the phrase, ""**on** my period."" She remarked that it sounded odd to her, almost British (we're both American). When I asked her what she says, she said, ""I **have** my period.""

On the other hand, my boyfriend calls it ""girl week,"" which, I dunno why, but I just think that is so cute."
r/AskWomen,I use Thinx overnight (tampons during the day) and I really like them. I have the fullest coverage/absorbency and have never had a leak. I rinse them out in hot water with some laundry soap each morning and let them hang dry. I have two pairs I alternate. Then they go in the wash with my regular laundry after my period ends. I like giving my body a break from tampons overnight and not having to worry about how long I wear them if it's a weekend and I'm sleeping in or something.
r/AskWomen,"The first IUD I got was awful. I cried the whole time, even after taking painkillers. After one year, it shifted, so I had to get it replaced.

The second time, I had better insurance. They numbed me, which (hurt but also) reduced the insertion pain. It obviously hurt real bad though, because they had to take the first one out and insert the new one, so double-ouch."
r/AskWomen,Vitamin D and pre-natal since I’m hoping to get pregnant soon-ish
r/AskWomen,"I'm not a recluse hermit right now but I went from being very very social with everyone to barely seeing anyone after some traumatic events happened. I stopped focusing so much on my outside life and instead focused on self-care. I look back and realize that was exactly what I needed to do at that time. About a year into my self-care ""recluse"" phase, I realized I was ready to go back out there and socialize again. Having said that, while I need a social life to be content, some downsides have come with that... but it's all about balance.

If you're thinking about laying low or taking a step back, listen to your body and do it. People can be overwhelming and complicated and sometimes all you need is a reboot."
r/AskWomen,"I honestly don’t think I’d ever date someone who was indifferent to it. It’s a pretty big part of my life and I can’t imagine someone being compatible with me who was indifferent.

My SO is a huge and very devoted feminist. We have some differing views within feminism, but he’s very engaged with the issues."
r/AskWomen,"In secondary school, my two best female friends and I started being friends with this guy who didn't go to our school. He was really nice at first in an awkward, lovable nerd kind of way. He was funny and listened to the same kind of music as we did.

After a while, he would always start bringing alcohol with him when we spent time together (I think we were about 16 or 17 at the time, so we couldn't go to pubs). He would ""playfully"" suggest  playing games to see who could drink the most the quickest and he would always pressure us to drink way more than we were comfortable. One day, one of my friends got really drunk after playing one of his stupid games and this guy kept insisting that he would take her home and make sure she was safe. Absolutely fucking not. I told him that I could handle this and he was enraged. I don't think a guy who had purely innocent intentions would get so angry after being denied access to a girl so drunk she could barely stand. We stopped hanging around with him after that."
r/AskWomen,"It was like any other high school, except everyone was much wealthier families than I did, I graduated with like 300 fewer people than I would have at public school, and we had to wear uniforms (which kind of sucked a lot considering my body type, but oh well). Plus a lot of Catholic aspects because it was a religious private school. That’s as general as I can really think, the question is fairly broad."
r/AskWomen,Mental health
r/AskWomen,"Yes. Not his father, but his mother for sure. She was very hovering and dependent on him, some would say controlling, and dictated a lot of his decisions. She was a nice woman and it didn't day to day directly impact our relationship, but in the big picture of compatibility it did. I was raised to be, and love being, independent and self-sufficient. Making decisions around a career path, travel, and handling money are all things I think people in their 20's should know about or manage, but he did not and submitted to her control on all of them.

Ironically, I think he's now dating a woman who is dependent and micromanages him and his decisions. Sigmund Freud is rolling in his grave in delight (jk)"
r/AskWomen,"My give a fuck meter dropped significantly as I aged, and my acceptance of my body the way it is skyrocketed. I'll never be Scarlett Johansson and that's okay."
r/AskWomen,"Sexism frequently makes me angry. But what angers me the most are predators who hang around my social circles, pretending they are good guys while they are preying on insecure women to abuse. Usually, when that happens, yes I do express my anger, so everyone including the guy can hear it. But recently a woman came to me with such a story and I've been keeping it under wraps at her request. When she is safe from him, then I can let everyone know and blast him with ighteous indignation."
r/AskWomen,"Honestly, sex in general."
r/AskWomen,"After being sexually assaulted, I was told by my platoon sergeant that it was up to the police to decide who the victim *actually* was"

r/AskWomen,"Based on where I've been and my interests my vote is Savannah! I took a girls trip there and we went to the beach, did kayaking, went downtown and enjoyed alcoholic slushies while walking along old cobbles and did some shopping. We went to a rooftop bar and did a bicycle ghost tour. 

Other ideas might be Smokey Mountain Ntl park, Denver, Austin, San Diego, Miami, Boston, and the bachelorette favorite Nashville."
r/AskWomen,That I’m not good enough for him. It causes a lot of anxiety but my boyfriend tries to help me deal with it as much as possible
r/AskWomen,"For me...in high school, my so called ""friends"" knew i had a crush on a guy. About 3-4 of them came up with this elaborate idea to make me think the guy had a crush on me. They ""dropped"" a note by my feet by my locker, someone said ""oh look that fell out of your locker"". It was a note, supposedly from my crush. Don't recall the contents but enough to get my hopes up, they let on for a few days until I was about to ask him about it. One other girl who knew about it but wasn't part of it, pulled me aside and told me. I was so embarrassed and crushed that they'd pull something like that. Never really recovered, separated myself from that group after that."
r/AskWomen,"All my tats are phrases but my favorite is ""olim meminisse iuvabit"". It's from the Aeneid and means ""one day it will help to remember.""


You see, after the Trojan War, Aeneas and his posse are sailing the Mediterranean seeking a new home when they are hit with a massive storm (Juno don't play). Everyone is freaking the fuck out on this matchstick boat, certain they are going to die. Aeneas has to do something! So he tells them that although the situation is dire, one day it will help to remember it and how they survived. Posse chills out after this pep talk.

HOWEVER, deep with his heart, despite his brave speech and words, Aeneas is thinking ""We are **so** fucked"".


It's an inspirational reminder to myself to hang on when in the shit because I will come out of it tougher and wiser. BUT it also makes me laugh a little thinking about Aeneas lying to his men. It's one of my favorite parts of the epic."

r/AskWomen,"Do something different to break your normal routine. Try to do something new each day, it doesn't have to be massive. It could be something like going to bed earlier and waking up earlier, or studying someplace new etc."
r/AskWomen,My little brother kept calling me a lesbian or that I wanted to be a boy. My mom was shocked but got over it. Decided to wear a hat until it grew out. I like not doing my hair but not how it actually looks on me. I've done it 3 times.

r/AskWomen,"I don't think that everyone has someone out there for them, that there is The One you need to find.  I do think that for most people, they can find a good partner if they are willing to do the work to make it happen.  That involves having a lifestyle that supports a relationship, taking care of their own emotional maturity, and being willing to meet people and collaborate with them."
r/AskWomen,"For me, my breasts became more tender when I moved up in cup sizes."
r/AskWomen,"Ask them if they need anything/how they would like me to support them.  Tell them it super fucking sucks.  Let them vent. 

Not much more I can do."
r/AskWomen,"I don’t know, I guess when the smiles and laughter stopped. Also the conversation dried up and all that was left was rage. I’m still hoping to rekindle the relationship. Try harder, be better. Less impulsive. It hurts."
r/AskWomen,Wear socks! They keep your feet warm.
r/AskWomen,"If I never experienced any of the side effects of not sleeping and always felt totall refreshed? Yes. I love sleeping but it's mostly because I love the feeling of waking up after sleeping.

r/AskWomen,"Singing. I wouldn’t say I’m terrible, but I wouldn’t say I’m good either."
r/AskWomen,"It's hard, cause they often feel lonely. Abuse comes with imaginary idea of great love from the abuser towards their victims and making their self-esteem low and pushing the feeling that they'll never find someone to ""love them as much"" and ""treat them as well"". It's almost like an addiction, and I've seen women often missing the abuser when some time passes, as they get soo used to it, and they start romanticising the good moments. 

&#x200B;

Take care of them, help them out when you can, don't leave them spending too much alone. Try not to be annoying and turn it into babysitting at the same time. But if they decide to ""slip back"", there's nothing you can really do to keep them away from getting into the old habits."
r/AskWomen,"I had a dude call me pregnant as an insult. I found it amusing. I know what I am and what I’m not, names don’t usually hurt me. Pregnant women are beautiful and I just found it ridiculously immature and comical."

r/AskWomen,I become distant
r/AskWomen,"I think I actually enjoy Reddit the most. It’s a good time killer that doesn’t kill my battery, I get a few good laughs out of it and can read about some interesting things. I recently discovered the unsolved mysteries sub so I’ve been browsing that on the days when I have an hour between my classes or a few spare minutes before my shift starts. There’s unlimited content and it’s usually far more interesting than anything I see on Twitter or IG. It’s also a nice break from the people I see and hear from every single day. I don’t really have full conversations with people on here but the small interactions I have here and there are refreshing."
r/AskWomen,"Fantastic. I get them in my undereye hollows and a bit in my cheeks to restore some lost volume and it’s honestly amazing. I look the same, just so much more refreshed. Nobody asks me if I’m tired all the time anymore."

r/AskWomen,"I'm not sure how it changed, but I used to be very closed up emotionally until my first couple of intimate experiences with death/losing people. I cry very easily now and I'm generally a more openly sensitive, vulnerable and expressive person, and it feels much more genuine to who I am. I don't care for coming across as ""tough"" so much even though I had a tough childhood and learned to be very tough with myself (and this hasn't gone away completely). I just don't care to hide how I feel anymore cuz life is too short.

At first I couldn't even grieve properly. I had to take care of everybody else who was grieving before I felt I could physically cry or feel anything. That was pretty weird. Now, I can cry at my own thoughts... at anything beautiful, at anything painful."
r/AskWomen,"It's fucking *hell.*

I don't know if I'm sad because I should be sad or if I'm heading into a depressive episode.

I don't know if I'm appropriately excited about something or going straight into mania.

I don't trust my own emotions or my own brain.

I am medicated and the entire world is grey."
r/AskWomen,"He was one of my only friends, and he knew that. I explained to him that I'm lesbian. He was accepting, kind, and still wanted to be friends! Hell yeah!

Then came the jokes. He'd make sexual jokes way too often. I tried to brush it off as friends joking around, but I eventually asked him to tone it down. Then came the, what I call, ""fan-fiction."" I talked about how he could come to my place over break because my parents wanted to meet this friend I've been talking about, but that he had to remember that I'm in the closet. His response? ""Well, ya know, I could be your beard if you wanted. You could say that we're dating. Not that we are! But then it might get awkward, haha. I mean, we'd have to hold hands in front of them and they'd probably expect us to kiss, so of course we'd have to do that to make it convincing, and maybe make some noise at night..."" And it was so uncomfortable. 

Then came the belittlement. Little side-comments to try and convince me otherwise. ""You know, lots of girls THINK they're lesbian in college but are just in a phase. Not saying you are! But you shouldn't bother dating girls until you graduate."" ""But how do you know? I mean, not saying you aren't, but you've never hooked up with a guy..."" ""I read this thing about how lesbians are more likely to end up in abusive relationships than straight women. Not saying you will! But it's crazy that no one talks about how men are safer."" There was also the usual talk of ""I'm such a nice guy but no girl wants me,"" and I'd always reassure him that he would find someone, I'd always try to get his spirits up and make him feel better. 

This went on for 2 years of friendship until the final straw. He tried to trick me into going to his graduation. Like, he told me I'd stay at his parents' house so my parents wouldn't have to travel so far to pick me up (I can't drive). It would shave an hour and a half both ways off of their trip. I tell my mom this, she's relieved, all is good. Then, it turns out that he and his parents are heading back to the university for graduation way earlier than he said... and I'm not allowed to stay in his house alone. I have to go with them. So not only do my parents now get an even longer trip, not only do I have to lug all my stuff back to university, but he bought me a ticket for his graduation, so he planned this all along. Cherry on top? When I said that I didn't want to go, his parents were deeply offended, because they didn't understand *why a girlfriend wouldn't want to go to her boyfriend's graduation.* ***He told them we were a couple, and had been for over a year.*** When I explained it to them, they didn't care, because I was hurting their baby boy's feelings. Besides, I had no choice but to come with them and I had nothing else to do, so just sit in on graduation!

As a final ""fuck you, I'm done with your shit,"" I refused. I sat in the lobby with my stuff next to me for three hours while I waited for my parents. It didn't matter that I had nothing to do, because I would not give him the satisfaction.

Had him ghosted for a year now."

r/AskWomen,"I was an idiot and got mine done with a piercing gun, don't be like me, get yours done at an actual piercing shop. The gun doesn't have the force or sharpness to get a really clean pierce so it pushes some skin with it. Due to that I have a small bump around the back of my piercing holes. They aren't perfectly straight either. 

But most of all piercing guns cannot be fully cleaned, you can autoclave piercing needles but you can't do that with a gun that has plastic components. I'm just lucky I didn't get a nasty infection."

r/AskWomen,"My mother (59) never married and believes she’s better for it. She talks a lot about the emotional responsibilities most men she’s been romantic with expected of her and how it just never seemed worth it. 

She also, rightfully, points out how a lot of older women we know who have lost their husbands always seem excited for a new chance at life after they die. Not in a morbid way, more like jumping at the chance of no longer have to cook his meals, do his laundry, etc."
r/AskWomen,"I find it slightly awkward. Not offensive, just unnecessary. I don't want special treatment, I just want to be equal."
r/AskWomen,"Being comfortable in saying “No”. 

Wether it’s to an invite we don’t want to go to, or to someone pressuring us to do something we’re not comfortable with. We don’t have to give a reason or an excuse, “No” or “No thank you” is enough.

Edit: you can give a reason, but you shouldn’t have to make something up for “No” to be acceptable."
r/AskWomen,I was in the hospital with my best friend who had just given birth.  It was a C section and the hospital staff wouldn't let her baby stay in the room with her unless there was another able-bodied adult there. I was staying with her while her husband went home and prepared the house for baby's arrival. Another friend of mine called me every 20 minutes to see how soon I could take her to the grocery store because she had a headache and didn't want to drive.  I don't miss her.

r/AskWomen,"If my partner liked to dance, but I wasn't fond of it, I'd dance with him every now and then and other times leave him to dance on his own cause he doesn't need me to do everything with him. That one isn't a big deal at all and is an easy compromise. 

When it comes to sex stuff, I don't want my partner compromising and I don't want to compromise. If there's something he likes that I am neutral on, sure, let's do it! But if it is something I actively dislike, or vice versa, it's just not going to happen. No one should perform, or have done to them, sex acts that they do not want to do/receive. 

So, I suppose sex stuff is my limit."
r/AskWomen,"In my early-to-mid teens (13-16), yes! Extremely codepdendent.

r/AskWomen,"I don’t know if this qualifies, but my boyfriend and I had a bad issue with his father. His father is in his 80s, very lively and outgoing, but also a HUGE hoarder. Like, filthy junk everywhere, house filled to the seams with papers and his late wife’s things (she died 7 years ago and he still has her old shampoo bottles).

We were trying to help him clean up the house and make it livable after we saw it, since we had no idea he was living in such squalor. He’s perfectly healthy and active, takes dance lessons, etc. but he just couldn’t part with anything emotionally. Therefore, he hadn’t had anyone in his house in years. This vibrant, social, popular man with tons and tons of friends couldn’t have anyone over to his house. This poor old man couldn’t have his grandchildren visit him because his house was such a hazard.

When he was fighting with me over throwing away old, tattered coupons for stores that don’t exist anymore and damaged floppy disks, I realized it was going nowhere.

So I sat him down, and asked him, “Do you want your home to be filled with people? Or stuff?”

He thought for a second and replied, “...People.”

Then he let us finish cleaning his house. It took all day but it would have been impossible if he hadn’t realized that this STUFF was keeping him away from the people he really cared about."

r/AskWomen,"A big part of it is accepting that it's not pleasant, but it's normal and it will pass. If theres anything you can identify that's triggering it, you can try to avoid that thing, but honestly it depends what it is. Sometimes that's not realistic. 

I just finished a trauma centric hospital admission, and one of the most interesting things we learned was that fighting intrusive thoughts and flashbacks actually teaches your brain to do it more often. You have an intrusive thought, so you try to push it away. It works, you feel better, and your brain ends up learning that pushing these away = dopamine hit... So it gives you more of them to try and get that hit again. 

Be gentle with yourself, know that it wasn't your fault, and that what you're going through is normal and valid. I hope the therapy helps you. It's a long and hard road, but its worth it."

r/AskWomen,"For me, it meant becoming more flexible with the work that I wanted to do. My partner's chosen career field pays better than mine and is more place-bound than mine. Once I decided that I didn't want to be a professor, it was easy to focus on other opportunities with the knowledge that I would move if my partner needed to move for a better position. A lot of colleges/universities will do their best to hire both of you if they can or to offer placement assistance if they can't. Rather than rely on that, I would recommend thinking through your goals and figuring out whether long-term long distance is a workable option for you or which of you would be the ""trailing spouse"" if not."
r/AskWomen,"You either can or you can't. 

If you're someone who can't, no tips are going to be able to help you because it is going to be inevitable.

It was so ugly, just like murky bubbley orange and green and brown blobs. He insisted on hanging it right where everyone could see and it was really just haunting and  UGLY I hated it more than anything. 

Anyways he was abusive and cheated on me A LOT and right after I told him I knew I said I hated his art this whole time and everyone laughed about it behind his back and I wanted to burn it. 

This 30yo man fell to his knees and was pulling his hair and screaming and he rips the canvas off the wall, nails go flying, he runs to the balcony and CHUCKS it over the ledge. We were on the 3rd floor. It shatters all over the sidewalk and he’s screaming at me “YOU DID THIS!!!”. 

That was enough lmao 

Tldr I told my abusive cheater ex his art was ugly and he threw it off the balcony"
r/AskWomen,"Not shave my body hair and still have people show interest in dating me, lmao. 

Pretty much anything where men say ""guys won't like you if you do that"" total bullshit."
r/AskWomen,I’ve become friends with two women who had both dated two separate ex boyfriends of mine. It’s awesome.
r/AskWomen,"It would be fine as long as there were no cultural hiccups regarding the role of women in his life or incompatible ideas about what I may or may not be ""allowed""  to do.."
r/AskWomen,"I'm a surgery tech in a plastic surgery clinic. Body sculpting can involve many different procedures and treatments, each one having varying healing times/ processes. Lipo isn't always fun - pain can last for months after the procedure. Most of the time, if you're removing fat/tissue from an area specifically (abdominoplasty, significant lipo, etc) then expect to have drains in for a couple weeks post procedure to prevent fluid from filling up inside. There can be significant swelling, and there is no way to predict how you'll scar or any guarantee on how your final results will look. 

Please please please make sure you're going to a very well experienced provider who thoroughly answers all of your questions and makes you feel comfortable. Also some surgeons may feel more comfortable taking procedures one at a time, while others may do a bunch at once. Many providers will not perform major surgery on someone with a BMI above 29. This is not discrimination, this is avoiding very real health risks. Look around till you find a doctor that works for you. Please don't just go cheap. 

Not trying to scare or deter you in any way. I'm just discussing the things that patients often don't think about or expect. If you feel like this it's a right step for you, go for it! Just be 100% informed as you do :)"

r/AskWomen,"“Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine” is currently on my nightstand. It’s been there for months, because I’m unable to read more than a couple of pages at a time before I get bored."
r/AskWomen,"I didn’t “rage quit” but quit after resentment and discontentment building for about 4-5 months. 

It was worth it because didn’t feel like I was selling myself out for a decent paycheck. 

Do you mean what happened after? I made sure I took up other projects and there wasn’t any gap in my CV while searching for other jobs. Landed a good one about 8 months later and I’ve been with that firm for about 4 years now. 

I also made sure to be upfront in my exit interview about why I was leaving. 

It worked out."
r/AskWomen,Sure. I’d hire a person of any gender if they came vetted and referred.
r/AskWomen,"Two. Capital One was my first card, and I just signed up for Chase Sapphire Reserve."

r/AskWomen,This isn’t really a thing you can just do here (UK) but I get one every year as a hospital outpatient as I have a long-term condition.
r/AskWomen,My dogs. Seeing them is pretty much the only thing guaranteed to make me at least slightly happier.
r/AskWomen,"Not dreading the chaos! I lay out my clothes, tidy up the room, set up my makeup and stuff how I want it. Make sure my keys are hanging up and there’s toilet paper on the roll and shampoo in the shower."
r/AskWomen,"I'm usually the main cook. My dude does his fair share and he ALWAYS does the dishes. I just season better and I have control issues in the kitchen. Plus I like making meals for my family, makes me feel like a real adult."
r/AskWomen,"Two ways:

1. I got a job in retail where I'd be forced to socialize w/customers 8+ hours a day

2. I was shy as fuck in middle and high school, so immediately after graduation I told myself ""I will never see these ppl again. I can finally be myself."""
r/AskWomen,"I mix half zucchini noodles and half spaghettini, and top with avocado pesto. I don't have exact measurements because that's not really how I roll but here's a vague estimate:

-1-3 avocados (depends on their size)

- tablespoon or two of olive oil

- handful of fresh basil

- parmesan

- salt + pepper

- enough lemon juice to make it blendable

- pine nuts if you're feeling fancy (I usually don't bother)

Toss it all in a blender/magic bullet and done. Taste + adjust as needed. Top with more parmesan and halved cherry tomatoes. You can add some chicken or crispy tofu if you so desire."

r/AskWomen,"Physically.. sex with a condom makes me feel like I'm being fucked by a solid, tube shaped balloon. It just feels like rubber, even with the thinner types.

Emotionally, there's no difference for me."
r/AskWomen,"Yep, that's me. I don't check most of the boxes to be labelled as conventionally affectionate – I'm not a big fan of hugs; I find it difficult to hand out compliments just to be 'nice' and initiate small talk unless I really mean them; I suck at flattery; and I value my personal space a lot and don't like to be clingy with others or others being clingy with me.     

While I realize that my inability to be conventionally affectionate does hinder my relationships (platonic or otherwise) to some extent because it can be sometimes construed as me being deliberately cold or discourteous, it's not a dealbreaker in and of itself since I have had enough people I could get along with swimmingly because they have been pretty understanding and accepting of me.      

If there's any dealbreaker, it's the fact that I find it difficult to *maintain* relationships, despite being lucky enough to have come across people who understand and accept me for what I am. Most of my relationships with people (excluding my family) are on a superficial level. I can go about my life perfectly fine without seeing or interacting with my acquaintances, 'friends' and coworkers for days on end, and frankly speaking I don't really miss them if I don't have them around. When they are around though, I can keep up a perfect demeanour of sociability – I can hear out their problems, empathize with them, crack jokes and laugh with them, discuss a common area of interest or hobby, and go out for coffee or lunch. But I can't commit myself to them wholeheartedly, if that makes any sense. In other words, I can engage with people superficially but have difficulty forming any deeper emotional bond with them. This aspect of my persona, as far as my understanding goes, hampers my relationships more than my inability to show affection."

r/AskWomen,"I started pole fitness about 2 years ago! I go when I can get to class (usually once or twice a week) as I don't have the room to install my own pole. Also depending how hard I go for it, if I fuck myself up I'll give myself a rest haha. I've lost 3 and a half stone so far! Strippers earn their money, man. That shit is HARD WORK. I love it though, even the bruises 😂 Also the sisterhood at class and pole community outside it is amazing."
r/AskWomen,Tossed a frozen burger pattie into hot oil. Way too hot. Splashed back right into my eye.
r/AskWomen,"I had someone tell me that I was the first boss she’d ever felt safe disclosing her chronic mental health condition to, which made me feel kind of sad for her but really happy for myself that I’d inspired that level of trust. It felt really good to be able to set up the accommodations she needed and deserved without her having to go through stress to get them. It mar me feel like I was making a real positive impact in her quality of life."
r/AskWomen,"I'd say it's made me far more aware of how boys are socialised, and that's helped me to understand men better. Things like I noticed how my brother just didn't grow up with an expectation to tidy after himself, get involved with domestic chores or be a caregiver to others; whereas it's pretty much implied for girls to do these things. Equally, my brother was expected to be sporty and active, strong and outdoorsy, whereas I wasn't.

And now as an adult, in general the men are worse at things like cleaning than many of the women I know (not uniformly across the board, but generally) but also much more likely to do garden work and manual labour tasks. It doesn't excuse the unequal behaviour but it did make me more aware of the differences in how we were socialised, and how that could be indicative of wider social norms and expectations."
r/AskWomen,"By asking questions instead of making statements or accusations. 

""How are you and xyz doing?"" 

""I noticed he said xyz, does he say things like xyz often?""

""How have you been feeling about your relationship?""

Things like that. Let them take the lead afterwards. When we get too pushy/accusatory with people in abusive relationships, it can have the opposite affect, pushing them further away from us and closer to their abuser."

r/AskWomen,Not even kidding: alcohol. I was damn passionate about it. It was also killing me.
r/AskWomen,When he started being cruel to me and said it was because I needed “tough love”. I grew up in an abusive household so to have a SO (who I loved and trusted) say that to me was devastating. I walked right out the door and never looked back.

r/AskWomen,"I do logistics and supply for the Army. 

If you're relatively healthy and in shape, don't have an extensive criminal record, and:

* starting base pay of ~$3100/month 

* free healthcare

* extra money for rent (exact amount determined by zip code COLA) and groceries

* opportunities to do all kinda of crazy shit that I guarantee you 95% of other people never get to do 

* Depending on how long you have left in college, ROTC very well could pay the rest of your way. 

interests you, being an Army (military in general, really) officer might interest you. 

I took a bit of a different route (not the college type of officer), needed a job when I was 18 because couchsurfing sucks. 

Army took me from some loser who was genetically predispositioned to ending up as a heroin addict and prostitute, and 14 years later I'm set for a career, I've met a ton of friends, my kid's college is set, been all over the world doing crazy unique shit with awesome people, and I got my bachelor's and master's in something I can take with me when I retire. 

And I'm eligible to retire from this at 38.

r/AskWomen,"I don't know if it's still a thing or not, but there used to be a website called Rotten. It featured a lot of pictures of recently deceased people... heads blown off, burned corpses, shit like that. Younger me was curious about death but I got a bit more than I bargained for. It was repulsive."

r/AskWomen,"At first I was going to comment about a dumb guy I dated once but since you mentioned a close friend, I did recently go through a bff breakup if you will. This girl had major insecurity issues that she took out on me in subtle ways. I never really noticed until I went to her birthday dinner and she was SO nice to the one other girl who was there. It was like night and day. Literally decided to not be friends anymore and slow faded on the friendship. There was no fallout drama, but I'm pretty sure I was her last remaining real friend. I don't feel bad, because I have plenty of other gal pals who lift me up and celebrate me instead of trying to tear me down. Well I feel a little bad. But I don't feel that she deserved any more of my time."

r/AskWomen,"I first noticed my husband because he was wearing $2 flip flops. It was sooooo freaking sexy over the guy I’d just broken up with who wore $800 custom Italian shoes in high school where he was either bragging about them or crying because they’d been lightly scuffed. 

I scanned husband up and down from there and the rest of the package was equally as hot."
r/AskWomen,He found the love of his life on Ashley Madison 🙄
r/AskWomen,When I realized she had a consistent history of being completely self-absorbed. She'd expect me to prioritize her phone calls but she'd never do the same for me. She would expect my emotional support but rarely gave it. She wouldn't empathize with me. I didn't have a big fight with her. I just disengaged. I'm actually much happier without her.
r/AskWomen,"I had once gotten my hair cut, lightened, and colored with like a purple ombré. Eeesh. It was EXPENSIVE. I saved up for that for sure. Probs $300 or so? My hair was long at the time too, but they chopped it. Oh man, I was reaching real deep in my pockets for that one.

But another service I paid for was this Korean body scrub at a Korean spa. It was around....$60? But daaaaang, when the lady started scrubbing and I was seeing like eraser shaving type dirt coming off? I’ve always been clean and hygienic, but this was a FULL body exfoliating scrub. SO worth it. It’s no joke and you end up having THE SOFTEST skin ever. But you have to moisturize after that and if you do it properly, gosh you feel clean and smooth and soft. Amazing."
r/AskWomen,"I donated eggs in my early 20s. Although I am glad that I did it I would not do it again and I’m not sure I’d recommend it either. It’s a pretty big time commitment as you have to go to a number of doctors appointments and will poked and prodded so many times. You also will have to inject yourself with fertility hormones daily leading up to the actual retrieval. The drugs made me really bloated and emotional and I did not enjoy it at all. 

It feels wonderful knowing that I may had made someone’s dream of becoming a mother a reality. But what I went through to do that was a lot."
r/AskWomen,"I once attended a baby shower where we played a game in which someone put a piece of a candy bar in a diaper and microwaved it, and then we had to guess which type of candy bar was in each diaper.

Do not do that."
r/AskWomen,"I would dispute the premise. I think the overall atmosphere for young girls is pretty grim. The number of female role models is no higher than it ever was, and is certainly counteracted by porn culture and reality TV culture."

r/AskWomen,"Firstly anyone who says they’ve always had good mental health is either lying or kidding themselves. Even those of us without serious mental problems have had rough spots. we get mentally sick just like physically sick

That being said I’ve been blessed with good brain chemicals for the most part. I do have a genetic disposition to occasional anxiety but it’s well controlled with avoiding my triggers and using Xanax if needed. 

I’ve always had a positive mental outlook tho- and this has shaped my life by being an optimistic and happy person who is very productive and enjoys all life has to offer (even the bad parts)"
r/AskWomen,"My parents were pretty lax with the computer and monitoring what I did because they didn't know how to use it.

I'm not gonna be over-protective, but if I have kids I will watch what they're doing online closer than my parents watched me. There's some bad shit out there. I was exposed to a lot."
r/AskWomen,"It depends on what the fight was about. 

If it's something relatively trivial that you both got heated about (example: I once got into a big argument with a friend over my getting better loot drops in Diablo 3 than him and he was convinced JUST CONVINCED that I was cheating at the game to make him look bad), then I find it's better to be the person to reach out and say ""I'm sorry things got heated and we fought but you're still my friend and I'm sorry that I said things that upset you."" Make sure that it's not a non-apology, one of those ""I'm sorry you feel like I said mean things"" kind of things, where they're the ones at fault for getting mad. Whether you meant to upset them or not, you did, and should take ownership of it in an apology."
r/AskWomen,"Didn't have money growing up, so I never had ""cool"" clothes. Made me really self-conscious."
r/AskWomen,Have you ever given a compliment to a woman and watched her light up? That look of happy surprise. Adorable.
r/AskWomen,"So, I believe what happened to me is mild. I don't know if I repressed the memories or just didn't think much of it until I grew up and realized it was kinda fucked up. 

I don't remember when I start recalling that weird day, but being older and having experienced some stuff in the relationship department, I had sort of and epiphany at one point. I realized I was used as an experiment, my innocence was taken advantage of, because I was 9/10/11 and I just wanted to play marriage and stuff, and then I started feeling weird about myself because I kinda liked it at the time. I felt things.

I think of that day often. I wonder how that shaped my current view on relationships and intimacy, if it did in any way. I don't feel bad, I don't hate the person, I don't know if they remember and honestly I wish they don't. It's just a thing in the back of my head that I don't really know what to make of."

r/AskWomen,"I still think about the girl in high school that sat next to me, after talking to me for a bit she offered me gum. I politely declined and she just said “yes. You do.” Didn’t know her well but she had my back! Always the best way is offer gum or mints."
r/AskWomen,"I went to a wedding where they had a table at the back of the ceremony with pictures of important people in their lives who had died -- grandparents, friends, etc.  I think the guest book for signing was also on that table.  One of those friends had died within the last year at a tragically young age, and many of those attending knew him.  It was a lovely way to acknowledge that there were people not in the room that some folks would miss and feel the absence of, without letting it take over the day."
r/AskWomen,"Doesn't relate to being a woman specifically, but to being a quiet, reserved person. This was something I struggled with a lot as a kid. I saw my reserve as a handicap and didn't think I'd go very far with it. But my mum - the champion of self-acceptance - gave me a piece of advice that has stuck with me through life. It roughly translates to,

""Remember that sparrows live in the same world as eagles. They're not as fast or as strong or as aggressive. But they still live, thrive and are happy. Because the world is meant for everyone - not just the obviously strong. You're the sparrow in your world of eagles. You just need to find the place that is right for you.""

I remember and thank my mum for this still :)"
r/AskWomen,"None, because I’ll sweat it off. Australian summers get really hot"
r/AskWomen,"A few months into living together, me and the bf had what remains to date our most serious, angry, impassioned fight over whether or not vertical farms are a meme or a viable form of agricultural.

r/AskWomen,"After a breakup, I told myself that I was still going to work towards getting to a point where I could go ""all-in"" on my next relationship. I wasn't going to let the breakup keep me from putting myself out there and committing to the next relationship. I was very much inspired by Kahlil Gibran's ""On Love"".

I ended up in a new relationship, and my friend read that poem at our wedding last fall. It felt like a huge risk, but the rewards, man. The rewards."
r/AskWomen,2-3 depending on how stretched out the ponytail holder is
r/AskWomen,"I live in a pretty small town so I see everyone all the time. I have such bad anxiety going anywhere. I always scan parking lots before I go in anywhere and scan rooms as soon as I walk into buildings, just so I can avoid people if I feel like I have to. It’s awful & honestly not a lot of people understand... it’s weird when you’re shopping with someone and they randomly turn down another aisle without saying anything to avoid someone. I’ve tried therapy but all my therapist basically told me was to get out of this town but in order to move, you need money and that’s just something I don’t have. 

Don’t bully people, it just really fucks them up later in life. Or at least it did to me."
r/AskWomen,"My current partner was in foster care and was in a ""relationship"" with a foster sister 5 years older than him (11 and 16, respectively). He doesn't see it as abuse of any kind, he says she was totally his ""type"" and that she took care of him when few other people did. While I respect that, I've addressed that if he were an 11 year old girl and a 16 year old guy did the things that they did, it would be considered abuse. His viewpoint is that maybe in other situations it would be abuse, but at the time he thought he was the coolest kid in the whole foster home and that all the other kids would high-five him and such. I'm not about to insist someone's lived experiences are false, you know? I think there's just a different perspective for women than men when it comes to sexual stuff; young boys are told early that sex is a sign of power and losing your virginity is important, whereas young girls are told that sex is bad and that it's horrible to lose your virginity."
r/AskWomen,"I'm not sure when I got it at first but I have a pretty good happy trail. Definitely way too many hairs to pluck. Starts at my belly button and well... Goes all the way down. I just take a second to shave it in the shower. It's the only thing I shave regularly.

Edit - and while it's not my stomach, I also have chest hairs, those are more sparse though, and even a random hair on my right breast an inch or so under my nipple."
r/AskWomen,"Can it be someone I know *of*? Cause.. Lena Dunham and Donald Trump. 

There's also this girl I know who is extremely talented. She dances on stage with big name celebrities, is in music videos, can sing her ass off, a wonderful artist, and SOOOO beautiful. One of the prettiest girls I've ever met. So, as a result, she is very popular and liked. 

However, I went to school with her for many years and she is one of the most hurtful people I have ever met. She's extremely mean. For much more than a year she sent me anonymous messages online calling me terrible things and telling me to kill myself. She did it to others as well. From what I hear, she still as terrible today as she was then. It's a shame, she's got so much going for her but is absolutely horrid as a person."
r/AskWomen,I love wasting time by telling strangers my random opinions and thoughts on things.
r/AskWomen,"Myself and a male coworker were traveling for training and all our food was on corporate card so naturally we went out to eat every night. The first night we went out he offered to buy me a beer after we had both already used our companies standard 2 drinks per day on the corporate card. I accepted and that was that.

That night we were at our hotel and were texting to coordinate what time we would meet in the morning at the car to leave and at the end he texted ""night, girl"". I reply that was inappropriate for a coworker to address me as ""girl"" and told him so. He apologized and said he used that term for a lot of people. Which is fine for people that you doesn't work with, so I told him that and we moved on.

I found out recently that he had gone to  our manager after that and told him I had ""shot him down"" for buying me a beer. Saying I ""for some reason had to set him straight"" when all I was doing was asking him to give me the respect you would give a coworker. He just had to make it seem like I thought he was hitting on me.

Working in a mostly male environment this has made it so everyone thinks that if they are nice to me I will take it as flirting and make it a big deal.

I know he wasn't flirting! I just don't like being called girl!"

“You’re way too long for the train, probably. Unless we fold you in half? We could stow you away maybe.”"

r/AskWomen,The urge to text an ex.
r/AskWomen,"Not overtly, but I think I internalized the idea that as a woman I should “give him a chance because he’s a nice guy” and “not be shallow”. I think this contributed to me dating guys that I wasn’t attracted to in the hopes that they would be nicer to me than the good looking guys that I assumed were jerks. I later realized that treating a woman well has nothing to do with how a guy looks. A guy can be shallow and self-absorbed no matter what they look like."

r/AskWomen,"I'm a ""long sleeper,"" and I don't feel fully rested unless I get 9 to 10 hours of sleep a night. Generally though, I get less than 7, because I have to wake up so early for work, and I'm a natural night person.

Typically, during the work week, I'll get anywhere from 5 1/2 to 7 hours of sleep a night, and then I'll sleep for 8 1/2 to 10 hours on the weekend. If I'm especially exhausted though, I'll definitely sleep for longer. Two weeks ago, I slept a combined 24 hours on Friday and Saturday night. I hate sleeping that long, but my body apparently needed it."

Later that night I went outside to grab something from our van, he slammed the door onto my sleeve and drove off with me attached to the vehicle. I felt the front tire run over and pull my ponytail. I honestly thought he was going to kill me that night."
r/AskWomen,"My best friend was poking fun at my choice in men (I prefer big dudes), and he said that if I was in England, then I'd be rich because I always have so many pounds on me.

Rude, but witty."
r/AskWomen,"My SO didn’t necessarily lose a biological parent but lost a grandparent who raised him as their child and who he saw as a parent. It was a very tough time and honestly I felt lost at that time as to how to help but throughout that time I made sure to 

1) listen. Listened to everything he had to say about them, the good, the bad, and even the silences. 

2) never made it about myself. I avoided saying things like “if I were you...”, “I can’t imagine...”, etc. This wasn’t about me. It was about him and his relationship with them 

3) let them cry and cried with them. I know how hard it is for my SO to be extremely vulnerable with anyone and when he cried I couldn’t help but just cry with him, I feel like that really helped as he was able to not feel so alone. 

In the end everyone deals with death differently so the way you handle it with your SO should be the best way to make them feel comfortable and loved."
r/AskWomen,Masturbate
r/AskWomen,"It's my favourite American major city! Lots of culture and great food, always a lot of events and cool stores. As an artist I especially enjoy it, lots of really good visual artists around and galleries. I find it a ittle less big box chain dominated compared to like Manhattan these days."

I would be laughing my ass off, because that's my serious kind of humor."
r/AskWomen,"Oh I didn’t know going to the spa with others was the norm. I usually go by myself, but I always like to get calming facials or a deep deep tissue massage."
r/AskWomen,"Ok, I'll bite. We lived in a nice area in a nice house. My dad had an extra just-for-fun sports car. I went to a private school. We had a country club membership, a vacation home, and we went on multiple week-long vacations every year.

As far as my personal life, my parents wanted to see me succeed as well, so they were very strict. That meant no TV (my parents intentionally didn't get cable for this reason), and I wasn't allowed any videogames or computer games. As a result, I've read a *lot* of books. My mom was one of *those* moms who obsessively controlled my diet. They also signed me up for a lot of classes, activities, and extra tutoring, so I had a class or activity every day of the week after school and on weekends. I don't remember ever having a lazy Saturday morning because Saturday mornings were for violin group class followed by Kumon math drills. Summer was for more activities and summer intensive programs. 

My dad grew up very poor (literally South Chicago housing projects) and I think he was afraid of raising complacent children, so anything extra (latest phone, trendy clothes, gameboy, music CDs, gas money, etc) I was required to pay for myself with birthday and then part-time job money. They got me a used Honda Civic when I was 19, which I still drive to this day. They covered all the costs for my education, but I was still required to work through school to pay for my own apartment. Things like that. 

Obviously, I always had a safety net, but I'm just saying that my upbringing was different from a lot of my peers, which is probably who you're thinking about. I could tell you stories about that. Some of their privileges were, and continue to be, crazy. Although, you do end up benefiting from some of that stuff for free by association.

My parents also cut me off financially after college graduation since those are their values. They're enjoying the semi-retired life now and are constantly traveling to the point where they don't even bother tell me when and where they're going anymore. So, yeah. Not my money.

It is weird seeing people (like my SO) who grew up in families far less well-off than mine, but who were given so many more expensive things than I ever had. So I guess I'm thankful for the way my parents chose to handle that because I feel I'm more frugal than those people now, and I've done well in my own right so far. 

Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like to have a childhood that was more about fun, but the advantages I was given are undeniable, so I'm not feeling sorry for myself."
r/AskWomen,I’m 5’7 and I’d consider myself tall for a woman. Most women I encounter are usually shorter than me or my height. Though I wouldn’t consider myself noticeably tall where people look at me and “wow you’re tall”. I think when people think of “tall women” they think of 5’10+. Runway model height basically.
r/AskWomen,"My empathy is in overdrive to the point I avoid television and movies as their scripted emotions can ruin me for weeks. If someone is going through any sort of horror in media, I start to panic. I've thrown up too many times to count from it. On the lighter end, I cry when others cry, and laugh when others laugh.

However I have a very firm sense of self, high self esteem, and try to approach life with logic over feelings prior to reacting, so I'm not sensitive in the sense of being easily shaken, hurt, or reactive. I'm also a survivor of extreme trauma so in a crisis my brain goes into 'fix it' mode, emotional set backs don't ever get to me as I'm always focused on the next step. 

I feel what others feel, but less what they want me to feel, if that makes sense."
r/AskWomen,"Yes, I participated in bullying of a boy when I was in 5th grade.  I was punching down because I was also bullied a lot and was looking to lash out.  I still feel guilty when I think about it."
r/AskWomen,When we started talking about the future and looking forward to it. Making plans for it and agreeing on them
r/AskWomen,"I can think of a couple instances where I did this. They weren't particularly close friends, which I suppose made it easier. But every time we hung out, it turned into a therapy session (with me playing the therapist). They both had no goals or aspirations, were constantly complaining about their lives and situations but had no desire to make the slightest effort to change. I felt drained and discouraged after every interaction.

I know it sounds snobby on the surface, but I'm a goal-driven, educated person with a need to achieve. They are entitled to live their lives how they want, but this was one of those situations where the idea of ""you are the company you keep"" came into play. We internalize our company, whether we like it or not. On top of that I'm super sensitive and easily absorb the moods and energies of people around me."
r/AskWomen,"The notion of finding baby powder arousing made me dry heave aha. I always strongly disliked the smell but I also associate it with small children and the elderly. Neither of which do I associate with making me horny. Christ lol. So strange to me.

I just like my partner to smell clean. Some have had that linen smell, some minty. Nice. My partner has an almost caramel or smoky vanilla tobacco undertone to his natural smell that I am obsessed with, and he gravitates to products that reflect or enhance that.

On myself I like similar scents. Vanillas. Ambers. Sometimes very sweet and candy-like, some times more peppery and floral like in Gucci Guilty."
r/AskWomen,"THC products, International travel"
r/AskWomen,"Okay, so I misunderstood your question originally. Sorry.

My hysterectomy improved my sex life. I experienced dryness for a little while but it's better now and sex isn't painful like it was before surgery."
r/AskWomen,"I would call any of my exes ""real"" friends in that we don't see each other, hang out, do things together, etc.  But I'm still social media ""friends"" with *most* of my exes.  They were all people who were important to me at one point in my life and that all have admirable qualities.  I still care about what happens in their life and their pursuit of happiness.  Just because that pursuit of happiness didn't work out between the two of us, doesn't mean I can't be hopeful that they're able to find it with someone else (or on their own, if that's what they choose)."
r/AskWomen,"I think I got . . reverse catfished?? 

I got to the coffee shop where we were supposed to meet and I didn't see him. It's a small coffee shop and there was only 1 guy sitting alone, so I approached. . he looked up. . nope, not the guy from the photos, so I awkwardly smiled and shuffled away.  

I made a few circles and then went outside to wait. Eventually the guy who I had made eye contact came out and asked if I was FoxMulder-FBI- and I said yes. 

I normally have *ridiculously* good facial recognition skills, so I was very embarrassed that I hadn't recognized him. I got flustered and apologized several times. 

We get coffee and sit down. He is acting very strangely, like:

* Refuses to face me. His body was facing away from me and he would only turn his head to speak. I maneuvered my chair a few times  but nope, he would move to face away from me. 

* Expressed visible and audible disgust when I mentioned Pride Week. I'm not involved in LGBTQ issues or events,  but at the time I lived in the trendy gay neighborhood in my city and we were in a coffee shop in the gay neighborhood. Pride Week was relevant to the discussion of parking and events in the neighborhood. If you are disgusted by the concept of Pride Week . . .why the fuck did you agree to meet me here? I had suggested other places, sheesh. 

* Gave short, curt answers to all of my questions and didn't really ask me any. 

I quickly chugged my coffee in 15-20min and suggested ending the date ""I'm sorry, I'm just not feeling the chemistry here. I think it's better if we just end the date."" He seemed disappointed, which I did not get .. all of his signals were that he was having a bad time and was disappointed/upset with me. We left and never contacted eachother again. 

I went home and, just to see if I'm insane, went to check the pics in his profile and IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT HIM IN THE PHOTOS. HE USED PICTURES OF A DIFFERENT DUDE!! The *weirdest* thing is that the guy I met in the coffee shop was significantly hotter than the guy in the photos (and the guy in the photos was attractive).  And he came up to me and said my name first, so it's not like he was some stranger who was messing with me. I hadn't said my name to the coffee shop barista or anything, so it had to be the dude I was there to meet.

I've been on a ton of online dates, and plenty of them were bad. Most bad dates I just sort of laugh off like ""What an asshole"" or ""Wow, we look good on paper together but holy shit we have nothing in common."" But this one is one of the only ones that has stuck with me because it's just so damn puzzling. To this day I have no idea what this guy's deal was! The guy I met was so ridiculously attractive (great face and perfect slender-yet-buff body) why on earth would he use fake pics with a less attractive dude? So weird."
r/AskWomen,"I've only seen it happen once IRL, and it wasn't me or any of my friends, it was a very public breakup in a restaurant I happened to be in at the time. There was loud talking, then yelling, and then a drink thrown. And then me and my date looked at each other like wtf!? and laughed."
r/AskWomen,"I would be concerned for their mental health. If their parents are that overbearing in their 20s, I cant imagine what their childhood was like."
r/AskWomen,Yes sometimes if I just got paid I’ll go for champagne and oysters SOLO 🥳
r/AskWomen,"Most of the 90s. Economy was booming. Movies were balls-to-the-wall ridiculous and fun. No major wars. Then 9/11 happened, and, well..."
r/AskWomen,"I've had a few.

Friends that I got drunk around, hooked up with, and then discussed if we wanted to make it a more regular thing."
r/AskWomen,"I like doing what I consider “proper” skincare, where I pay attention to actives and use masks and peels and serums and layer products specifically.  All other self-care feels like a chore to me, but skin care doesn’t. It makes my skin look and feel nice, and then I feel nicer."
r/AskWomen,"Not amusing as in funny, but I read once that no congenitally blind person has ever been diagnosed with schizophrenia.

I think that's pretty fascinating."
r/AskWomen,"Is this common? I swear, when I was in high school, those who were in relationships just went together. Those who weren't mostly went with other friends (including me and my group of friends). There were a few who asked friends to prom as dates, but AFAIK it was fairly casual and nothing big."
r/AskWomen,"I don't. 

We do a ""hi, how are you?"" ""good! what about you?"" and talk about what I'd like. That's it.

I have never known a woman who gossips with their hair dresser or nail artist. As far as I'm concerned, that's a movie thing."
r/AskWomen,Around 80K. I have a J.D. I have a job in my field and I have no regrets.

r/AskWomen,"Down parkas.  No need to spend $800+ on a Canada Goose parka either. A perfectly good parka can be had for less than $200 when Eddie Bauer, Cabelas, Lands End and LL Bean have sales."
r/AskWomen,"Peace and quiet.  I tend to attract needy people who like to use me as free therapy.  Always being the sounding board for everyone else's drama, insecurities and problems gets old real fast.  Constantly having to reinforce boundaries is exhausting.

Also, freedom.  If I want to do something, I go do it.  Easy peasy.  No time wasted trying to coordinate schedules or trying to find someone else who wants to do it with me."
r/AskWomen,a partner who knew what he was doing and personally learning more about my body. thankfully that happened sooner rather than later.
r/AskWomen,"''i'm sorry, but i don't feel the same way.''

if they've nursed their feelings to be more than a passing interest/crush, it's their responsibility. that response is fair and decent in the case of a passing interest/declining a date and nothing more. you weren't a willing participant in the relationship they created in their head.

oh, quick note - if they haven't asked you out or dumped their feelings, don't be tempted to say something. it's not your responsibility to read their mind and anticipate their needs, and if you end up being wrong it's awkward for everyone!"
r/AskWomen,"I have struggled with this in the past and have found that you can’t pour from an empty cup. This means that if your needs aren’t being fulfilled you can’t truly be genuinely nice to others.

I approach this theory by first taking care of my needs: if I too tired or irritable to spend time with someone, I won’t go. If I am too busy to help someone out, I won’t agree to it. If I think someone wants or expects me to do something and I am unwilling or unable to do it, I will communicate that I am not going to do that thing.

I get enough sleep, drink enough coffee, give myself enough time to not feel rushed, and do things for myself. I show up to work on time or early every day. I go to the gym and take care of my finances and fill my prescriptions. I practice good hygiene.

Okay, once I take care of those things, I use my time and energy to take care of “our” things. I make plans with my SO and friends and stick to those commitments. I keep our shared living space tidy. I get candy and little gifts for my SO and friends if I see something they would like. I text and call my friends and SO throughout the day and stay updated on their lives. I am vulnerable with people I care about and allow them to be vulnerable with me. I apologize when I’m being neglectful or being an asshole. I ask for help when I need it.

And if I still have time and energy left after all that, I can pitch in on their stuff. (Hint, you aren’t always or often going to have time for this): I will do my SO’s laundry. I’ll help a friend move. I’ll make new friends. I’ll pick up a shift. I’ll run an errand for my SO. I’ll help my SO clean his room. I’ll have people over and entertain guests.

One thing that “nice” people run into is that they think of other people’s needs and try to have other people’s best interests in mind. They assume that the people they love and trust also have their best interests in mind in return. This isn’t true.

I’m not saying that everyone is trying to screw you over; I’m saying that nobody knows what you need or what is best for you like you do. Stick to your values. Say you don’t feel comfortable or don’t have time if you don’t. Say what you need, because you know what you need and they don’t. 

Sometimes it is awkward to say, “hey, I don’t want to go with you to that girl’s party, because I don’t like her.” Saying this and standing your ground is way way better than going to her party and pouting the whole time and then being upset afterwards that your friends made you go to a party you didn’t want to go to. Nobody wants to hang out with you in a fun setting when you aren’t having fun; you aren’t doing anyone a favor by going.

People won’t think you’re being mean if you put your needs first, and if they do, they aren’t people you want to be spending your time with."

I'll probably give the show a watch, just out of curiosity, but JFC. STOP DOING THIS HOLLYWOOD. Nobody wants or needs your shitty women led reboots of things that didn't want or need a makeover."

r/AskWomen,Love between a owner and their pet
r/AskWomen,"My MIL and I are both writers so we started from mutual interest. Then we spent a lot of time drinking tea together cause we lived with her for a while. And when we moved closer to her two years ago, I started inviting her to see shows with me. We started this tradition where I would buy the tickets (local/university theater so the tickets were less than £6 each) and she bought us snacks/lunch before hand. During those outings, we started having deep conversations and learning about each other. Now we're close.

With my husband's grandmother, it started when her husband was alive. I was respectful and polite and told them about my interests. So they sent me articles dealing with what I was studying. When his grandfather died and his grandmother started having dementia symptoms, I started finding her in family events and sitting with her, just talking. As her symptoms got worse, my mother in law asked me to take care of her when she came to visit. So I watched her and talked even when she couldn't respond. The proudest moment was last year when his grandmother walked up to a clerk and said ""my granddaughter needs a bathing suit"" and she took my hand. Also doesn't hurt that we share a name and a birthday ;)

I get to see them both next week and I can't wait."
r/AskWomen,"I lived in Germany for a year! I learned a lot, including:

Almost no one wants to hear about your experience living abroad, so I don't like to talk about it. Ime it typically comes across as bragging.

Other countries have problems too, just different ones.

People everywhere want similar things.

Immersion in a new language and culture is exciting and fun, but also scary.

Being alone in a new country forces you to pick up a lot of independence. I could always call my parents or siblings for help or advice, I could do the same abroad but it was significantly harder with the time difference. I figured out how to do more things on my own instead of asking for help. 

You should learn to navigate a new country's medical system *before* you need it.

Living in a larger city can be really great! I never thought I was one to enjoy living in a big city, but I loved it.

Traditions change wherever you go, but the best and most important ones are always centered on human connection. 

Living in a place where it snows is mystical and fun, but also a huge pain in the ass sometimes.

Europeans love California."

r/AskWomen,Being depressed.
r/AskWomen,Self-compassion. Without self-compassion there is little room for real regret. And self-compassion is the only thing I've found that really reduces its impact.
r/AskWomen,"My first name is the Spanish word for a mountain range (what my parents named me after), but it literally means “jagged.” My dad’s side of the family calls me a Finnish name that sounds like it, (“Saara”) and that name comes from the Hebrew name “Sarah,” which means “princess”. 

My middle name is the French version of my mom’s name, and it’s a biblical/Hebrew name meaning “sea of bitterness” (fun!). My Saint’s name is the female version of an angel’s name (Gabriel), and it’s Italian.  My surname is Finnish and we think it comes from an old word for “soldier,” but we aren’t entirely sure!"
r/AskWomen,Amazing when done right. Borderline offended when done wrong.
r/AskWomen,"Depends on the social media you're talking about. Having millions of karma on reddit means you probably spend your day on reddit - not many opportunities to become popular in real life.

Having many followers on instagram however makes you kind of famous - people see your face and I at least heard about Instagram ""stars"" who actually get recognized on the street, so I'd say their internet fame \*can\* transfer into real life."

r/AskWomen,"Well my success rate for orgasms is much higher. And most look nothing like a penis. They also vibrate, have different settings and are actually designed to please women. No chance of pregnancy or STIs. Clean up is easier. So I would say they win out. 

I have sex with men because I want the person and sex.

I masturbate purely for an orgasm. 

Kind of like all masterbation toys. You could get your own and try it out. But sex and masterbation are two different things. Sex (for most) involves a connection to another person and the pleasure from that. Sex toys are purely about self love."

r/AskWomen,"Yes, I used to have a lot of colour in my wardrobe but now I mostly own all black clothing."
r/AskWomen,"Be clear about your concerns, make a list of your fixed bills, average out both of your monthly incomes together and guesstimate how much you need to spend on groceries a month- budget in a certain amount for emergencies and ""funey"" (fun money) for each of you.

Remember that the whole idea behind living together is to support each other, that you are working together to make the relatioship work. Remember to both acknowledge that no one is accusing anyone of being 'bad at money', this is just to make sure you can spend and save in a constructive way. 

If you can, you guys should make goals, think of them as rewards for what all you have accomplished- right now my hubs and i are saving up to buy him a better vehicle. It doesn't have to be a difficult conversation, I realize it can be, but its still important. 

It also can reveal red-flags you didn't know were there as well- depending on how they react to the conversation. If its sheer avoidance to starting the conversation, or getting frustrated early on in the conversation, really look at it as a reason to wait to move in with someone."

r/AskWomen,"As a childless friend, still invite them out. Don’t assume they’ll never want to hang out. There’s a good chance they may not, but the invitation is nice all the same. 


As a mom friend, not blow off your friend’s struggles just because they don’t have a child. I had two kids, and got pregnant a third time, in the time my best friend got her PhD. The amount of stress she was under was surreal. We each were fighting very different battles"
r/AskWomen,"SELF LOVE!!! 

When you love how to love yourself, it’s like being wrapped in a warm potato hug you can snuggle in on rainy days. Meaning, you’ll have bad days where you feel like shit & you can’t compare to other women.

But then you will remember how to talk to yourself kindly because hey, life isn’t a competition. We’re not here to tear each other down to fit for the top spot. We are here to build each other up so we can have a great time while we’re here. 

Another woman’s beauty/success/whatever it is you want doesn’t take away from your own. Please don’t be confused. It has never been a competition between you and others. It’s a competition between you and yourself!"
r/AskWomen,"Heretonormivity is a thing, so because f&m relationships are a cultural default, you learn the differences by osmosis.

From what I've seen, there is not really a script for non-straight relationships...there are less cultural norms to follow, and that can be very freeing.

The trade off is that my wife and I still occasionally get asked who the man is in the relationship...some straight and bi people don't see a gay relationship is as valid, so their etiquette goes out the window."

r/AskWomen,"Very well, so far, but we have different functions in the business, and we are also very good at having knockdown dragout fights and then shaking it off."
r/AskWomen,"A few months ago and I’m in my late 20s. In the past I had always wondered if I just had trouble relaxing enough when I’m with another person, if I just needed to get more used to each partner (I’ve only dated guys for 2-3 months before things ended, nothing long term), maybe I just didn’t enjoy sex as much as other people, or some other reason. Nope, the guy I met a few months ago proved all my theories wrong the very first time we had sex, which was on our second date, a LOT sooner than I normally would. I honestly can’t even say exactly why it is and I’m sure it’s a combination of different reasons, but I orgasm so easily with him and I do every time we have sex now."
r/AskWomen,"Love. Trust. Free of judgement. Unconditional support. I have blood that I don’t consider family and I have family that isn’t blood. 


It’s a comfort to me, knowing I have people I can fall back on or turn to whenever I need them the most. I have a special needs child. My family are the ones that cheer for us whenever he hits a milestone, no matter how small or insignificant it may be to someone else. They’re the ones who visited my husband when he was hospitalized, and the ones who helped me out with the kids during that time. They’re with us through the highs and the lows and everything in between."
r/AskWomen,"That was like most of my teenage years. I look back and think “ah, teenagers” and try not to judge my past self too harshly. I’m still Facebook friends with some of those guys and our lives have turned out quite different. Neither has been bad, but just long term different goals. They’re all married and being dads around the small town I’m from. I’m happily child free and never want marriage and am glad I moved away."
r/AskWomen,"Everyday, I pick one thing about myself that I like. I started with how smoothly sloped my nose is. I like that. Kept telling myself that. Moved onto other little things. My friend suggested this and honestly it’s doing wonders."

r/AskWomen,"INTJ, husband is an ENFP.  No, we did not know our types before we met, so this was a fluke, but yes a funny fluke when I discovered it.  I think that it is pretty accurate, although I do find more INTJ descriptions to be hyperfocused on MALE intjs who IMO have more liberty to be who they are and are often treated like their traits are desirable, vs female intjs having been told since we were children that our traits were negative, since they are not, ""female"" enough.  So, my experience is that female INTJs are hard to spot, bc we have had to learn how to hide/dampen certain traits, due to (crappy) societal and family of origin expectations."
r/AskWomen,Don't monkey branch to another guy. Talk to your current SO about what want in a partner and if you feel it won't happen then leave because you want it for YOURSELF!
r/AskWomen,"SNORES.  So bad.  Like we used to sleep in separate rooms so bad.  Now we've finally hacked how to share a bed, and it only took 8 years to figure it out"
r/AskWomen,That I'm confident and have my shit together.
r/AskWomen,"I might be wrong but didn't the NHS recently release advice saying to do this and it turned out the placebo gap was actually only a thing because of some old religious beliefs that women needed to bleed? 
I've been doing it for years on the advice of my doctor because my periods can be so so awful. Would highly recommend and I personally have never had any weird symptoms or side effects?"
r/AskWomen,"Terrible. I thought the feelings were mutual because he was the sweetest thing on earth to me. They weren’t, and when he knew I was developing feelings for him, he kept seeing me. But started acting like a complete asshole, especially around his friends. The almighty fuckboy."
r/AskWomen,"I have 1, so not very."
r/AskWomen,Our boyfriends have total man crushes on each other so when we hang out they mostly just talk to each other.
r/AskWomen,"I'm not sure what it was. Maybe I just didn't want to hurt him, I honestly don't know. But I couldn't be happier I stuck around. Things are great, I feel at home with him. Zero regrets."
r/AskWomen,Black only. Easiest and lowest calorie!
r/AskWomen,"Loyalty, honesty, kindness."
r/AskWomen,"Financial wise, kinda hard here and there. Still a college student working entry level. 

Freedom wise, omg i love it! We've actually grown closer since not living together, but I wouldn't return unless it was absolutely necessary."
r/AskWomen,"I had pretend weddings when I was like 3 years old, so it’s something I always imagined growing up.

Now that I am 23 it’s gotten harder to picture, as I always saw myself getting married “as an adult” and I am now an adult in a serious relationship who is 100% not ready to get married yet (I’m still just too young!), and it’s hard to imagine when that time might be."
r/AskWomen,"Tbh, I only get it when I shave. Waxing seems to grow the ends in softer and I don't get the prickles!"
r/AskWomen,"Not applicable now because I'm a stay at home mom but when I used to I'd just make sure I had shower shoes, a towel, and I had mini bottles of shampoo and soap that you can just refill. Taking full size bottles is too much to carry around. Also some body lotion. I'd just shower, get changed and usually touch up my makeup."
r/AskWomen,I like to butcher the roof of my mouth with capt'n crunch
r/AskWomen,"Keys, wallet, phones."
r/AskWomen,That I can find humor in pretty much everything. I would go insane without it.
r/AskWomen,"Wasn't qualified when I applied. Figured they requested an interview because of my resume.

Interview questions rotated around if I would decide to have a family or get married soon. How would ""I"" (like there wouldn't be a father too) take care of them and work. Almost none of the questions pertained to the job, just a motherhood I didn't have.

Offered but didn't take."
r/AskWomen,Yes.  I'm happy because we work together as a team better than anyone else I've ever met.
r/AskWomen,"I hate missed notifications on my phone. I don’t get 476 unread texts, 85 missed calls, 6,688 unread emails. I mark all my emails as read and make sure no “red” numbers appear on my phone. It drives me crazy and I know it doesn’t matter"
r/AskWomen,"My husband isn't a liar, so I don't know any signs. 

My ex....well, one sign was that words were coming out of his mouth."
r/AskWomen,"I do part of the year. I'm an archaeologist, so in the field during the summer, the lab parts of the year, and then a desk the rest of the time."
r/AskWomen,"All the women in the Fast and Furious franchise. They are clearly meant to be cool girl types. They race cars and hack computers, oooooo... but they are also always the ones who end up messing up and getting caught or killed during critical moments in the film."
r/AskWomen,"I'm at home by myself right now! I'm watching old seasons of Project Runway, cuddling with my dog, eating Doritos, and mindlessly browsing Reddit. I ordered pizza for dinner because I didn't feel like cooking or leaving the house. It's been a good evening."
r/AskWomen,"Barack Obama is genuinely highly intelligent.

Just to be fair, I'm trying to think of a Republican who i can say is very smart, educated and well read, even if I disagree with them.  Problem is I don't really keep up with Republican politicians so I'm drawing a blank.  I'm curious to learn who they are though, if anyone wants to offer an opinion."
r/AskWomen,Frozen
r/AskWomen,"You just live, grief comes in waves so for some people time doesn’t always heal, just think about the memories you’ve made and try to live a good prideful life, even if it’s by waking up thinking only about what good things are happening today, and block out tomorrow if it’s too hard. Even getting up to go to work/school is something to be proud of, just live. Live and try your best. Some days are gonna go well, some days aren’t, accept that and have faith in the good days."
r/AskWomen,Went to see Endgame.
r/AskWomen,Because we usually fear the unknown and expect the worst
r/AskWomen,Ended the friendship.
r/AskWomen,I have a gym membership to a branch of a regional chain. I pay $42/ month and I go very rarely. But I’m resistant to canceling it because WHAT IF I find the motivation...
r/AskWomen,I like bangin’ because it’s hilarious. I hate the rubbing/bumping uglies one.
r/AskWomen,On my nightstand.
r/AskWomen,I don't even know what's on trend or not. I wear what I want when I want
r/AskWomen,"Nope.

I'm fat and society tells me I'm ugly, and it's been so long that I've internalized it, making me easy pickings."
r/AskWomen,"Slaughterhouse-5 by Kurt Vonnegut, it's my favourite book ever.

It is fairly hard to explain the plot without giving too much of it away, but I'd definitely recommend it. It gave me a different outlook on the world and much serenity."
r/AskWomen,Now? Just finished a jog. Having a good hair day. Wearing my favorite outfit. Feeling pretty good about myself.
r/AskWomen,Completely and utterly don't care about them in any way.
r/AskWomen,15-30 minutes from foreplay to afterglow cuddling on average.
r/AskWomen,"My husband and I moved in together about 5 months after we started dating, but we were practically living together after the first few weeks.

We got married 15 months after we started dating.

We’ve been married 4.5 years and things are still going strong! We have a 2 year old and I’m currently 36weeks with our second.
 It’s still early in our marriage, but without a doubt I’m still thrilled we got married and I love being with him.

What’s made it work so far is we just really get along. We have the same sense of humor, we agree on a lot of important aspects (finances, child rearing) and have the same goals for our life together. It never feels like a chore being with him.

We obviously both have our faults, but we’re usually able to apologize and move on fairly quickly when we argue and we try to avoid getting personal when arguing and stick to the actual issue. (Doesn’t always work, but we have a lifetime to practice).

He’s just my best friend and I look forward to every adventure we have together."
r/AskWomen,"This only happened once but I will always remember it. He started lightly patting the top of my head and saying ""good"""
r/AskWomen,"I told a long term boyfriend that his balding didn't make him any less sexually attractive to me, which was a full and complete lie but wtf else was I going to say. It wasn't a deal breaker, so what good would it be to tell him the truth."
r/AskWomen,Insomnia mostly
r/AskWomen,Two Dots.
r/AskWomen,He's an extrovert and I'm an introvert...when he goes out for game night with his buddies I stay in and read/paint/draw/write...it's nice
r/AskWomen,"Lol @ older.

I’m 29, I see my friends at least once a week. The longest we’ve gone not seeing each other as a group is about a month (usually due to work) and we would still talk online every other day or perhaps see each other individually. 

My friends are a massive and constant part of my life and we all make the effort to keep it that way.

Edit: some more info: we’re a group of 8, with other exterior friends/co-workers on the outer edge who join in fairly often too. Four are married, two are dating (not each other lol), and two are single. Only one of us has a child. Oldest is 34, youngest is 27."
r/AskWomen,"Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Skyrim!"
r/AskWomen,Bee Gees... I'm not old I'm not old I'm not old!
r/AskWomen,"I love it when I'm not carrying three full garbage bags of others trash off the bluff with me. If you go, take your trash with you and don't be an assbutt."
r/AskWomen,"This is a personal bias but, my great grandmother was a pretty badass woman. She was married off to a man 30 years her senior at 13. One day, he hit her. So she turned around and hit him back. She left him in a time where woman(especially Hispanic women)didnt leave men. She raised 12 kids and helped to raise 40+ grandkids and 30+ great grandkids. After that, she still felt the need to help and nurture, so she volunteered as a foster granny at local hospitals. She would stay and comfort terminally ill kids while their parents worked. Several kids and babies died in her arms. 

In her 60s her house was broken into and she was stabbed with a steak knife. She pulled the knife out of her arm and stabbed the robber in his chest, forcing him to flee. She didnt lwt herself be bullied by anyone. If she saw an injustice in public, she did something about it. She was a complete badass while still being a loving and gentle woman. My life goal is to emulate her and the other great women who helped raise me."
r/AskWomen,"It's really difficult at times. It's not like you're really allowed to point things out and complain about any of it usually. I have two modes essentially to deal with it. I have feminist mode where I just live as feircely as I can and speak my mind on the crap that's going on and don't conform to any standards set on women and all the other common feminist things, or I give in to all of it and say this is life and it's just easier to go along with all of it. I'll shave my body, I'll look my best and if guys are going to force their attention on me one way or another I might as well lean into that right? There's no in between for me. And either way I have a lot of trouble dealing with how life is."
r/AskWomen,Psychedelic rock with grunge as a runner up.
r/AskWomen,"I really hate the terms ""mommy issues"" and ""daddy issues."" They're terrible.

What the results of the lack of important, positive parental influence and love in one's childhood **will look different for each individual**. It may be trust issues, it may be over sensitivity, it may be coldness and callousness, the list goes on.

Everyone processes and internalizes things very differently."
r/AskWomen,"Pros: get to see all the animals, solid job security, pay can be good depending on where you go (it can also be really bad so look at your options), every day is completely different, there’s a lot of different directions and room for advancement, massive discounts on your own pets’ treatments, you get the satisfaction of helping people and — more importantly — animals, the office cat, you get to wear scrubs

Cons: sad stuff, disgusting stuff, long hours + stress on bad days, nuisance owners, chihuahuas with bad attitudes, massive dogs with bad attitudes, the process of having an animal tested for rabies, animal abuse/neglect, people with undoubtedly fewer than 5 brain cells trying to argue with you about things (I once had a woman bring in a dog who was spayed and so she had a tattoo marking that, and the woman asked me if... if her dog had babies, were the babies going to have the tattoo also.......)

And, I’m not gonna lie, the veterinary field has quite a bit of a problem with depression and suicide due to psychological distress, in the same way that doctors have long been known to. Many people — especially young women, statistically — simply aren’t emotionally equipped to handle some of the stuff they have to see, and they also suffer from the effects of crazy hours and unpredictable schedules leading to poor work-life balance. Client interactions can also be a great source of stress. So, you need to have some kind of system in place for managing these things."
r/AskWomen,"I've never dated anyone I wasn't sexually attracted too. That's usually the first inspiration to want to date someone isn't it? Sexual attraction first, and then hope the rest develops later!"
r/AskWomen,"Come home at 1am, drink a few beers, play switch or watch a funny show, cook something, pass tf out"
r/AskWomen,I found the cheapest hotel I could find on the coast for a 1 night get away and (it happened to be TravelLodge) and they had a pancake machine. So I had to give them 10 stars
r/AskWomen,"We made all kinds of movies as kids; i had a camcorder and supplied about half of the ideas and my friends were the writers/actors. One flick was about a sassy spy couple who had to save each other all the time and rode on 4 wheelers. Another was about a spooky sleepover where glowing red eyes made crazy stuff happen. Another was called ""spin the bottle"" and we snuck into the neighborhood hot tub after dark to film it; it had to do with dramatically announcing secrets like who murdered who and whose family was dead (??) and a lot of jump scares and such. There was a lot of fake gore in our movies and a lot of exaggerated screaming; it was pretty great."
r/AskWomen,"Plain epsom salts. My doctor told me to try an epsom bath with like 6 cups of salt and I was nearly non-functional after the first bath I took with them because I was so relaxed. I use San Francisco Salt Company also, I've noticed a huge difference when I don't buy high quality."
r/AskWomen,"Look closely at the other person. Almost always I find that what they're saying isn't actually about me, but their own insecurity and feelings of inadequacy. Then I tell myself that their shitty self-esteem shouldn't be my problem."
r/AskWomen,My need for alone time
r/AskWomen,"It was uneventful. We were young and hadn't been dating that long, and no one took it super seriously. Everyone was polite and formal. The first meeting wasn't really a good indication of what was to come."
r/AskWomen,Now. Getting a divorce.
r/AskWomen,"My SO retreats and I am the kind of person who wants to unpack it immediately. 
He likes to have space, think about it and then be reasonable. 

Both of these are totally acceptable ways to work through conflict... Harder when you're in the relationship with two different methods. 

At the beginning, we'd fight and he'd retreat and I'd follow. 
This was a recipe for disaster. I wasn't feeling heard and he was feeling like I was backing him into a corner.

Now when we argue, I allow him to have his space. 
It's helpful for me now to have those moments to myself to calm down. Try to see his side of things and evaluate my position. 

And then he allows me to unpack it. He's calmer and I am more rational."
r/AskWomen,Being able to go to college! I try my best not to complain about it (between the work and $80k+ in loans it’s tough sometimes) because I realize how lucky I am to have not only been able to go to college but now grad school!!
r/AskWomen,"""What's your favorite restaurant?""

&#x200B;

It's not a super deep question, but I like to see what people say."
r/AskWomen,"In order, I wanted to be...

- A farmer. 
- A biologist (to cure cancer or HIV).
- A geologist. 
- A psychologist. 
- A teacher. 
- A sex educator. 

I'm none of these things. I want to own my own organisation providing vocational training and social inclusion support to help people back on their feet (disabled, homeless, and ex offenders)."
r/AskWomen,"Communication, I was very aware that could be a problem so I made note to discuss it with him"
r/AskWomen,"Last weekend I accidentally purchased a book I already own (I was tripped up because the one I already had was a collection of stories and I got a standalone version of one of them, which I'd forgotten was in that larger volume), so I gotta return that and pick something else out. 

Apart from that, nada."
r/AskWomen,"He passed away a few years ago. I was 16, he was the star of the football field, it was classic. A large, muscular man, he had the most gentle soul of any man I have ever met. He cried over pets dying, or worrying about his parents health.
Then he was drafted and sent to Vietnam. He came back a different person. I wasn't the same person either, but not due to tragic, soul crushing war.
We parted. We tried, but it wasn't going to work. I didn't understand his PTSD. He didn't understand my new itch to experience my youth.
Many, many years later, just a couple of years before he passed, we spoke. He was still one of the finest men I have ever known. He adopted handicapped babies and children dying of fatal illnesses. I am honored that he was my first."
r/AskWomen,All the ones that were major traumas. My mind would be Swiss cheese but I'd be happier
r/AskWomen,Bah
r/AskWomen,"In addition to the retinol comment, I’d suggest you start using sunscreen regularly! There are plenty of lightweight ones on the market that don’t feel heavy and greasy like the ones you use to go to the beach. Protect your skin and prevent those lines!"
r/AskWomen,Sweet and spicy marinated chicken thighs with brown rice and steamed broccoli.
r/AskWomen,"Solitude, being outside in nature and exercise. Often I'm just listening to music, although sometimes I'll listen to the ongoings around me."
r/AskWomen,I do not shave my legs and I think I’m pretty awesome.
r/AskWomen,"I had met this guy at a professional event. We started texting - after weeks of communication - I was traveling a lot for work so it was difficult to fix a date - anyways, we finally meet for dinner and he was charming, attractive and so on. I swear I wanted to just jump him right there - we had been communicating for so long and the sexual tension was intense....we go back to his place, and we start to kiss. Again, it’s wonderful and then he says “Oh God, I can’t do this, I can’t cheat on my girlfriend” - WTF?!?!??? Worst date, ever! 

I look back on this with laughter."
r/AskWomen,The fact that it had become a terrible friendship made it very easy. I just moved on.
r/AskWomen,"Everyday something needs to be done, doesn’t matter if it’s a finished product or not, it’s a good habit. Also, deadlines are good for yourself bc it helps you keep a steady momentum"
r/AskWomen,"Walking, cycling, hiking, swimming, kayaking, gardening, going to shows, concerts, movies, museums, friends houses, festivals, traveling, camping, doing puzzles, board games, watching tv, cooking, having sex..."
r/AskWomen,"Not looking forward to filling out the ""Reason for leaving last position"" part."
r/AskWomen,"“I understand each of those words individually” when I don’t understand. 



“I can’t hear you” when I can’t hear them"
r/AskWomen,"To me, an abuser is an untrustworthy shitheel forever. Being a pro athlete doesn't change that in any way."
r/AskWomen,Find a good therapist. Believe in yourself. Find positive influences. Take it one step at a time.
r/AskWomen,"When I was a teen I went to the mall with some friends to have lunch and see a movie. We took too long eating and were late to the movie, so we decided to just hang out instead. 

When I got home my mom asked me how was the movie, and I told her the truth. She was *furious*. She told me I should have called her to tell her we changed our plans, that I was irresponsible and what I did was dangerous. 

I’m 30 now and still don’t understand her reasoning."
r/AskWomen,None. I have sincerely hated every team-building exercise that any employer has ever held any place I've worked.
r/AskWomen,🔥🔥🔥Heartburn🔥🔥🔥🤷🏼‍♀️
r/AskWomen,The little triangle bit of fat between the arm and the shoulder - you know the one I mean.
r/AskWomen,"A crush has happened to me before.  But there was this quote from a movie:
“New things get old, just like the old things did.” 
That always stuck with me. So yeah maybe you leave your relationship and pursue the new and exciting thing, but that’ll become ‘old’ too, and you’ll realize that you lost something real/precious because you wanted to chase something shiny/new. 

That being said, if you feel like you are in love with someone outside of your relationship, you need to choose. Figure out why you’ve fallen for someone else, and decide what you want to do. Pursuing someone emotionally while in a relationship is still considered cheating in my book."
r/AskWomen,"If you're talking about relationships... I realized I wasn't the problem when he started blaming me for every little thing that went wrong in our relationship. He never took accountability for anything and always made me feel like I was imagining things. When I discovered that he'd cheated on every girlfriend he ever had and, used the reasoning that they were ""crazy,"" I realized that emotionally abusing women was a trend for him. He liked to blame the women in his life for all the bad things he was doing. One word: GASLIGHTER. He should come with a warning label attached to him. I wish I could buy all of his exes a round of drinks."
r/AskWomen,If you have such qualms it might be better to desist.
r/AskWomen,I just wanna get rid of all my debt and then I can afford to have dreams 😭
r/AskWomen,"Sarcastic, dark, kind of dry?"
r/AskWomen,I’m going to have to get my passport renewed 4 years early because there is no more room for more stamps. I’m 24.
r/AskWomen,"I had very blue eyes until high school, and then they slowly started turning grey, and later more green. Now they’re very grey with some green, no blue anymore. My sister’s eyes also shifted from blue to completely green! I hear this is somewhat common for people and wanted to hear more stories."
r/AskWomen,"Dog handler. 

Best part is seeing dogs grow a bond with me. I had one dog, at my last facility, that would go crazy as soon as I walked through the door. He would jump over the 4ft gate, right into my arms. He was *not* a small dog, it was hilarious and sometimes painful but I miss him! Dogs picking you as their favorite handler is just...very nice feeling. 

Worst part is there being fights to break up or cleaning the absolutely vile things that can come out of them, from either end."
r/AskWomen,When I suddenly become uncomfortable around them bc their body language shifted
r/AskWomen,"Recently this week. Because I wasn't setting goals or working towards anything. I was just drifting around without any real plan, even though I have a degree in a field I can definitely find work in. I just wasn't happy so it's time to change that."
r/AskWomen,"Whenever they want to. 

I hate, and do not participate in, the texting games of “oh but you have to wait a week!” and “who will text who first?!”"
r/AskWomen,"Oh it’s happened to me several times. Each time I immediately block them, it’s so beyond creepy. If I swiped left on you it means I’m NOT interested, so don’t come trying to find me. I didn’t make a mistake."
r/AskWomen,"My boyfriend has plenty of friends—more than me. But the real difference between us is how we interact with them. I run things by one or two trusted friends and talk about my relationship, but he doesn’t do that. He really only talks about events in his life and his feelings to me; his friends are mostly just people to hang out with."
r/AskWomen,Closer- Nine Inch Nails.  Instant turn on.
r/AskWomen,"I was 10 and at school. I felt I had to go to the bathroom amd when I pulled my pants down I saw my navy underwear was stained. I wiped and saw blood, I freaked out because I knew nothing about periods except that women got them, but I thought only adults got it. I made a makeshift pad out of toilet paper and continued to do that for a whole year because I was too scared to tell my mom. After a year my mom saw a stain in my underwear and taught me how to use pads.

Please teach your kids about periods even if you think that they’re too young, because some girls get them really early."
r/AskWomen,"Oh, sure.  Just because I break up with someone doesn't erase them from my memory.  They come to mind at all sorts of times.  

I have almost NEVER reached out to them at those times.  Why would I?"
r/AskWomen,"I need to stick to my macros and stop making chocolate chip cookies ""for my husband""..."
r/AskWomen,Leave earlier. :P
r/AskWomen,"We met on a cruise ship.  We were both performers, and I got on board about two months into his contract.  He played piano in my shows and we just completely fell head over heels, but he was supposed to be ending his contract about a month after I got on board.  So he plotted with the band master to create a different piano position for himself so he could stay on board for several more months.  Eventually his contract did end and we were long distance on different ships for a while, but once that was over, we moved on land together. Together five years, married two!"
r/AskWomen,"Got a job in a different country, moved almost 8000 kms, found an apartment by myself, learned how to cook. Also learning how to socialize within a culture very different from mine and how to get better at my work. 


Can't say there was a specific moment when I knew I was independent. It was a collection of small things that I did for myself, by myself - that slowly built up my confidence.

There are still days when I feel overwhelmed and clueless. But I give myself a pep talk - ""You've done this, this and this before. You found it hard. But you got through it. Look at you now, you're fine. Now take on the new challenge the same way."""
r/AskWomen,I’ve been 5’8 since fifth grade and haven’t grown since! (F21)
r/AskWomen,"Just don't. It ends up being a waste of time for you and the person you date. It takes time to heal and it's best done solo vs using someone for temporary comfort. It means you never really get over them, you've just replaced them."
r/AskWomen,Exist
r/AskWomen,None lmao
r/AskWomen,"I had sex one day, threw the condom and wrapper in the garbage, and then took the garbage out.

When my mom walked through the door, I immediately knew that she knew. She's always thought I don't understand when she speaks spanish while on the phone, so she was talking to her friend about how she'd went through the **taken out trash that was with the whole building's taken out trash** and found the condom wrapper. She said, in spanish, ""let me let you go now so I can handle her.""

She pulled the wrapper out of her pocket, held it at me, and said  ""what's this."" I didn't respond and she started crying and yelling about how I was too young and how I'd hurt her because she always thought I'd come to her first. I started crying, I felt ashamed. She didn't look at me the rest of the night.

After that, she started tracking my location and whenever she knew I was at my boyfriend's house she'd call and text me a million times asking where I was and what I was doing. I would come home and she'd ask if I had sex. Would always say in a disgusted tone ""let me know if you need a pregnancy test."" She'd come home early, without telling me, in an attempt to catch me in the act which I never was.

I'm 20 now and she still tracks my location and calls me if I've been in the same place for 20 minutes. Questions me and tries to catch me in a lie about where I've been and who I'm with because she's certain I'm having sex."
r/AskWomen,"It’s not my or anyones response that’s the problem. 

It’s having to concern yourself with how that response is handled that causes issues.

I just wish we all could respectfully decline any unwanted approach without waiting for the toxic and pushy reactions."
r/AskWomen,"Currently the biggest risk I've taken lately has been walking out of a job that has continued to grow sour over the last few years. Many changes within the business that aren't working leading to an eventual failing enterprise, probably very soon."
r/AskWomen,"Good. Not everything needs to be ""shared""."
r/AskWomen,Heavily rely on pinky promises.
r/AskWomen,Never bc they are pointless
r/AskWomen,I’m ashamed to admit that all I really know about them is that Victoria Beckham was the posh one and that their Wannabe song is a classic.
r/AskWomen,I tend to like most dark humour.

r/AskWomen,"It definitely upsets me, especially when it’s not something I’ve noticed on my own. (Whether that be underweight or overweight.)"
r/AskWomen,"I think I would just choose to come back and huant the world to bother the people I love in funny ways. I'd manifest in moving things slightly, or writing words like ""Boo!"", or motivational junk on their steamed up mirrors.

Oh! Oh! I'd write things with their gross shower hair!"
r/AskWomen,I’ve shaved my head. It’s wonderful and liberating.
r/AskWomen,Nick & Jess's first kiss in New Girl!
r/AskWomen,"My bed. He had a full size mattress his mother got him before she died. He was sentimental about it.  I had a queen size we slept in. His boss was giving away a king size pillowtop with 4 post bed frame. Given that we lived in a 1 bedroom, having 3 beds was stupid. 

I told him I'd sell my mattress since he didn't want to part with his, but should we ever break up, I would be taking the king. He agreed. 

Then we break up 2 years later.  He says that what he agreed to shouldn't count because he didn't think we'd ever actually split. He wants the bed. Every time I made him mad during the 3 months it took him to actually move out, hed scream ""Do you even want a bed to sleep on?!"" Finally he moved out, and I decided not to be there.  But first, I replaced my bedroom doorknob with one that locks with a key. He was livid.  I still have the bed."
r/AskWomen,Game of Thrones and Avengers: Endgame
r/AskWomen,"As a lesbian, I am fully prepared to be disowned when my family finds out I’m gay. I want to come out within the next year and I’m terrified because I want to go to professional school, and I don’t know if I can afford it without help. It’s a rough situation but my girlfriend has been so understanding and supportive. 

Outside of that, I get erased a lot. A lot of people don’t think lesbians are actually gay, and there are also a lot of people who identify as lesbian when they aren’t, so I get a lot of people going “What do you mean you don’t like guys? My lesbian friend Christine has a boyfriend!”  or dudebros telling me they fucked a lesbian. I think I was molested by one of those guys once? Idk. It’s tiring. I hate the look in their eyes when I can tell they don’t believe me."

r/AskWomen,"Hahah just found mine! My favorite would probably be:

&#x200B;

""Dear Diary, Today president Obama made an address to all students. No offense to him but, IT WAS HORRIBLE! After school I went home ate a green smoothie (just food dye!), choked on a cracker (almost died), and me and mom went to go buy chocolate."""
r/AskWomen,My free time. I’m very selfish with it.
r/AskWomen,"Hands down, my mortgage, followed by student loans and car related expenses."
r/AskWomen,"Uhhh...so pre-2000?  Most of life has been lived without social media, so I can imagine it quite well."
r/AskWomen,I don’t have sex outside of being in a relationship. Not worth it to me.
r/AskWomen,That I will change my mind one day.
r/AskWomen,"My best friend passed away two months ago.

&#x200B;

Because of the nature of her death, I had \*so\* many people constantly reaching out and offering to talk. I understand everything was well-intentioned, but my brain wasn't necessarily thinking rationally at that point.

&#x200B;

My favorite messages were ones where people acknowledged ""don't feel the need to respond, but I'm thinking of you and here if you need a friend,"" or something along those lines. That way I felt they were genuinely trying to be there for me, and I didn't feel pressured to console them in any way. 

&#x200B;

This being said, death of a close family member/friend is never easy and there's no straight path to grieving. Just try to be supportive and understanding in any way possible. They might not realize it in the moment, but it helps having someone who's there for you."
r/AskWomen,All the time.  It's one of my biggest hobbies.
r/AskWomen,"I was about? 8 or 9? I only had a Barbie fishing reel, and my dad was talking to my uncle, not paying attention to me. I put a worm on the pink hook (because OF COURSE IT HAD PINK HOOKS) and i cast out. Not long after, I got a bite, and it looked like I legit caught a fish! I reeled it in as quick as my little arms could. i got him up on the bank, and saw he was almost as big as I was, and I grabbed the pole and kept yanking. I yelled to my dad to help me,  he saw how big it was, and his eyes got HUGE.

He moved like lightning to get to me (thinking it was going to yank me in) and right then, the line snapped and it flopped back into the creek. I was disappointed, but my uncle and cousin were ery impressed.

Thats my only catfish story."
r/AskWomen,I really love Fitness Blender workout videos! They have a really wide range of workout types and they're all free. I've been doing their workouts for a few years!
r/AskWomen,His sense of humor. My ex husband is an asshole but he’s a hilarious asshole and makes friends easily. So does our daughter
r/AskWomen,"It very much depends.  It can be lovely.  It can be ""yeah, yeah...no big deal"".  It can be really creepy.  It can feel disbelieving, because if you love me, how can you do what you just did?  It can be annoyance or amusement at feeling manipulated, someone saying it just to try to get out of trouble.  

I mean, they're just words.  You can have a wide range of reactions to them."
r/AskWomen,"open office floor plan 

ugh"
r/AskWomen,Flew in a private jet to a film premiere and walked the red carpet.
r/AskWomen,"Wouldn’t mind. It’s his body, and none of those things are permanent anyway.

I’d like a heads up though, I once had a shock when my then-fiancé shaved off his beard and walked out of the bathroom looking like he was 13. I married him anyway once the beard grew back."
r/AskWomen,I listen mostly to male artists because i enjoy deep voices a lot more. Most females are too high pitched and it starts annoying me or i get a headache.
r/AskWomen,"My partner has several allergies which cause asthma, and he has Crohn's. It isn't currently life-threatening, but it scares me. 

Right now, the allergies only mean he can't be active outdoors on some days, and we can't have pets or hang out at the places of people who have pets.   
The Crohn's mainly causes more laundry to be done. I had to get over being grossed out by things he can't prevent. 

I know it could be much worse. I'm afraid it will be worse in the future, because there's no cure."
r/AskWomen,"Sneakers. My mom always says I can’t wear anything other than sneakers because god forbid something happens, I need to be able to run away fast and without tripping. Anyone else’s parent say this kind of shit? Lol!"
