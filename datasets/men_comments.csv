r/AskMen,"My wife has become disabled, uses a wheelchair, and passes out due to low blood pressure.  When she passes out,I have to keep her propped up and make sure her head doesn't flop forward cutting off her breathing.  

I can see it coming but she fights it saying ""I'm okay! I'm okay!"" but inevitably succumbs to the disorder.  Sometimes, she's so determined that she sleepily says ""Told you."" just before she really wakes up.

Also, even when she's totally out of it, if I say ""I love you."" she will respond like a passed out drunk saying ""My-muv-mu-moo""."

3.  Ask for materials at these checkups on how to prepare

Edit: thanks u/silent_boy for this, but for 1., make sure the doctors that see your baby are in your network and not just the hospital; u/Ghostinthesky has a good point on free ultrasounds and recommends checking for some local services to begin this process of searching for care and knowledge on raising kids!"

r/AskMen,"Be upfront about your interest in him.  Don’t put him on the spot about gauging his interest first.  Your being vulnerable by “admitting” your feelings first gives him as much control as feasible so his introversion has the least likelihood of bailing.

r/AskMen,"When it happened to me:
I was in college, living in a 7 bedroom house with 6 dude roommates.  My (M) high school girlfriend had just broken up with me a few months before, she met some dude at school that she was into and our relationship had been distant for a while.  Nevertheless it hit me hard as it was my first serious relationship.  Not much happened with that dude and my ex was single.

A month or two after our split I met a super-hottie that I somehow managed to convince to start dating me.  We went out to the dinner + movie and came back to my place afterwards to hang out.  This is probably about 3-4 months after my split from ex-gf whom by now had made a few comments indicating she wanted to give ""us"" another shot.

So after the date super-hottie and me walk into my house and there standing in the kitchen is my ex...with a couple of my roommates hanging out.  I walk up to her and ask her what she's doing here...she tells me she's just hanging out with her friends ( aka **my** roommates that helped me through the break up and that I hung out with all the time).  She told me to not worry about her while her face clearly had some anguish and discomfort.  I just stood there wondering why the hell my bros would invite her over?

I went upstairs with my date and we watched a movie and fell asleep.  I told her I was sorry about my ex being there and she was super cool about it but was also slightly uncomfortable with my ex being in the same house as us.  She knew the breakup was painful for me, and we discussed it openly.  

The communication there was really important.  Her feelings being in the open, as well as mine, given that it hadn't been that much time and that it was painful.  

Super-hottie and I have now been together for 15 years, married for 11+.  She's still smoking hot."

r/AskMen,"I don’t consider myself to be of “high societal status,” but I am a lawyer at a large firm. My wife is a social worker who makes a fraction of what I do despite having a master’s degree. But I found her extremely attractive on both physical and personal levels and fell in love with her, and fortunately she felt the same, so we got married. A lot of financial success comes from choosing a specific career path and having some luck within it. If someone is a CNA, who’s to say she wouldn’t have been just as good of an investment banker if she’d gone to school for that instead? It doesn’t really say much about the qualities of a person that would inspire romance. Plus, once you marry someone, boom, she’s in your “social class” because you share your income. Problem solved.

Your problem is that you fail to interact and flirt with girls you're interested in.  Be fun, playful, confident, bantz a bit and it'll make her desire your attention, she'll want to be around you. 

How do you interact, joke with your buddies?  Bring that mindset when starting a conversation with a girl you're interested in.  Forget that you want to date this girl, if you had to entertain an elderly women or a group of kids how you would joke with them, charm them.  Don't see it as a threat or something you're worried about fucking up, just a casual stage that you get to perform on."

I'm so ridiculously shy and anxious, I'm 26 now and not even kissed a girl since 2013 (I was in a long term relationship then), I have a habit of sabotaging any chance I get before it goes anywhere and if it ever does I always panic and make an excuse 

The other week I was at a party and went outside for some fresh air and a girl I liked came out and we were talking, she took a pic with me for snapchat and we were talking very close, and whilst I could have gone in for a kiss I let the moment pass and fucked it all up

r/AskMen,"He’s dealing with a lot of self hatred and shame right now.  He doesn’t accept his amputated leg so he’s mentally preparing his emotions for when others don’t accept it either, namely you.

This may sound crazy, but I recommend you have him strip to shorts or undies and just sit like that in front of you. That way, he can’t hide it.

Have a good look at him and tell him that you still love and accept him. That you still want to be with him, that he’s still attractive , and that an amputated leg changes nothing. 

And then joke that bionic men are hot.

It’ll be risky, but it may help him face the shame and push through it."

We've had disagreements, but always handled rationally and calmly.  We've never raised voices or shouted at each other, slept in separate rooms, or any of the other relationship tropes like that.  

I've honestly had someone tell me that arguments are basically a requirement for a healthy relationship.  Garbage."
r/AskMen,"this is a good question really.   Healthy people attract healthy relationships.  Unhealthy people attract unhealthy relationships.  you can be lonely and still be emotionally healthy.  you can also have tons of dates and be emotionally unhealthy - in fact i am pretty sure that is the majority of the population :)  

my one buddy does this - very lonely unhealthy dude who grabs anyone that comes along and they are typically awful women.   He knows this but makes excuses for them.   Eventually he figures it out, moves on and then gets lonely and repeats the cycle because he is not willing to address his own issues.  Has cost him a lot of money (the women use him for that while he uses them for other things) and of course the mental pain.  


so how do you know?  well, good friends will be honest with you usually.  Seeing a counselor would help who can act as a good sounding-board and help lead you along the path.  Typically you know regardless, but are less likely to admit its a bad relationship the more unhealthy you are."

r/AskMen,"I had a girl as my first child and I really think they're easier at getting you into parenthood.  Boy or girl, dad's generally can't play with them like we want for about 5 years.  My daughter is older now and she's just starting to hit puberty it seems.  My fear/challenge is her getting emotional outbursts.  She'll overreact to mild criticisms some times and storm off.  She'll ""fib"" as a joke and then deny that she was lying at all.  Just that sort of stuff.  Prior to that, girl friendships in school are WAAAaaaay more complicated.  Luckily my wife handled all that for the most part."
r/AskMen,"OK so I’ll speak to this. I went to a high school that had separate guys campus and girls campus. At the end of the school day the girls will be bussed over to our campus but my day was spent with guys. A lot of the teachers were male as well which for me was really different as I grew up having predominantly female teachers. That said I think it shipped me in several different ways. 

For one the things I was able to talk about in class such as when a book brought up masturbation (Absolute True Diary of A Part Time Indian by Sherman Alexi) and we could laugh about it instead of getting all weird with girls around. There was a kind of mentality of “get your shit together“ with reality checks as well that I appreciated in my time in high school. Guys and girls would date but we really didn’t have much interaction with them except for at pep rally’s or if they lived in our neighborhood.  iThere was a girl that I decided to date and then take to my prom that was nice and we got to know each other. Following prom we dated for a couple months but looking back I really did not understand dating simply due to my lack of experience and my perception of girls was different. Also I have a sister several years younger than me. 

I think had I gone to a coed school I would’ve not been as weirded out at the time about stuff such as periods and talk about sex. It wasn’t until college that I grew comfortable talking about sex and periods and all those things that happened to people that are normal but they can be deemed taboo especially at a Catholic school. My sister right now goes to a public school that’s coed and honestly I wish I had that experience because I think I would’ve acclimated well. I remember in college I got all giggly when I realized that girls had to wash their underwear in the laundry room too. Now I think I’ve acclimated fine but I think it did hold me back a little bit socially going into college and how to interact with girls."

r/AskMen,"Confrontation is the best solution to such things I find. Shrugging off problems because their ‘small and insignificant’ will often lead to the problem becoming not so small and not so insignificant.

r/AskMen,"> we talk for days before so I know they know my personality

You don't really get to know someone until you're in a room with them. In fact, when I was on dating apps, if I spent a long time talking to someone before the date, the date tended to never go well. I'm not totally sure why, but I think it let both of us build an idea of what the other person was like, and the more fleshed out this (fake) picture is, the more jarring it is to have to start over with what the person is really like. Needless to say, neither I nor my dates were being intentionally deceiving.

For better or worse, dating apps mean going on lots of first dates. Other than very basic, obvious stuff, the filtering starts when the date starts. If the date doesn't go great or you don't hear back, look on that as part of the process, not a failure."

r/AskMen,"Well, I can add to this debate. 

I have been going through chemo and as a result lost ALL body hair. Now it must be considered that this is much more than pubes, taint, crack, ahole- the works. 

There are many benefits to not having pubes, such as less itching, adjusting and silky smooth balls. 

However there are a few drawbacks to being hairless, including needing to use powder to keep the shaft from sticking to balls or other. Also, hair seems to be essential to normal farts, my theory is the ass hair keeps the checks just far enough apart to allow for gas to escape. Without this essential space, the fart kinda wiggles up your crack for a “top fart”."

r/AskMen,"I'm a (mostly) straight man who works in a gay nightclub, so I think I have some insight to offer here.

At first, it's really flattering being hit on all the time. My first few months of working at the club was a constant barrage of men flirting with me, and it felt good to be constantly told I was attractive and have all of that attention on me. There's a definite ego boost that comes with people validating your looks on a nightly basis. 

However, not all of these experiences were good. I've been sexually assaulted by customers at work countless times. I've always heard my female friends talk about how men at bars and nightclubs are really scary and unpredictable to them, but I never fully understood what they meant until it happened to me. It's equal part terrifying and humiliating to have someone touch you in such an aggressive manner, you're reduced to an object in the eyes of some drunk asshole who just wants to get his nut off. Obviously not everyone is like this, for every idiot I have to fight because they tried to grab my dick without warning, there's ten guys who are nothing but polite and respectful towards me. But those negative experiences far outweigh the good in terms of impact. I can't go into work anymore without having to keep my guard up at all times, and I never go to the club on my nights off because I don't want to have that same level of stress when I'm trying to relax and have fun.

I get maybe a tenth of the attention at work that my female friends get almost anywhere they go, and it's hard for me to be anything other than jaded towards men that flirt with me. I definitely wouldn't be able to handle it if I received attention from women the same way that they typically receive it from men."

What you're looking to do is overcome the damage that was placed upon you during childhood. Not become desensitized to it. Desensitization doesn't actually fix the problem, it just causes you to ignore/cope with it whenever it happens. I'd like to teach you how I overcame my damage, so hopefully you can do the same.

**Step 1: Separate Yourself From Your Father**

&nbsp;

When I was young, I'd always assume that when my father was mad at me, it was my fault. Which made perfect sense. I misbehaved at school. I failed a test. I broke something in the house while roughhousing. I wasn't listening when he told me to do something. I was always able to rationalize in my own head that I deserved the yelling and shouting that was brought upon me.

&nbsp;

Over time, as I got older, like you, I became non-confrontational. I didn't like raising my voice or getting physical with anyone. If people started yelling at me or demeaning me in private or in front of others, I'd allow it. Because deep down, I still held onto the belief that I somehow deserved the disrespect.

&nbsp;

This is a damaged and incorrect mindset to have.

&nbsp;

One of the most powerful realizations I ever had in regards to human behavior, is that people treat others the way they've been treated. Their responses and actions towards you are a direct reflection of how they feel about themselves and their circumstances.

&nbsp;

As I got older and more knowledgeable, I  found out that my father had a similarly tough childhood with his father. He'd actually end up moving out of the house right on his 18th birthday. He and his father never had a strong bond with one another. And because of this, he didn't have any positive male fatherly role model in his life to learn from.

&nbsp;

Because of his childhood experiences, he also grew up non-confrontational and emotionally distant. He didn't express himself well, and he was never really open with anyone in the family. He had damage that wasn't ever addressed or resolved, so he came into fatherhood with what he was raised in, because he didn't know any other way.

&nbsp;

I'm willing to bet your father is the same to some degree. Perhaps not as severe as my father, but if he had anger issues, it was because of past experiences in his upbringing. Things he never learned to address and correct before becoming a father himself.

&nbsp;

The first step in overcoming your damage, is to understand that your father's anger isn't your fault. Even if he directed it at you, it isn't your fault. He was never angry with you for the sake of being angry with you. He was angry with you because he didn't know how else to handle his emotions and reactions and express them in a more mature and productive way.

**Step 2: Realize That People Mirror Their Inner Feelings**

&nbsp;

To elaborate more, it's important to realize that people will only ever treat you how they're currently feeling in the moment.

&nbsp;

When people are feeling good about themselves and their lives, they treat other people well. This is a universal fact. You'll see them smiling, laughing, and with a certain shine in their eyes. You can feel their energy as it radiates from them and into you. It's infectious.

&nbsp;

Likewise, when people are feeling shitty about themselves and their lives, they treat other people like shit. They'll frown, complain, and have no shine or enthusiasm in their eyes. They'll avoid conversation with people, they'll tease and berate more positive and upbeat people. They'll just generally be unpleasant to be around. 

&nbsp;

This is important to know when it comes to dealing with people, and handling their behaviors towards you.

&nbsp;

A lot of people get hurt when they're bullied and teased. Yelled at by their managers or disrespected by close friends. They take the words personally, and the negatively slowly eats away at their self confidence and self-esteem.

&nbsp;

The words aren't a description of you. They don't describe your abilities or lack of. They don't determine your character or characteristics. When people are shitty towards you, it's because they're feeling shitty within themselves.

&nbsp;

Surprisingly, people hear this, but don't realize that it's the same for positive feedback as well.

&nbsp;

Though it doesn't need to be taken as seriously, because who doesn't love compliments; but when people are positive and nice towards you, it isn't necessarily because you're yourself a positive and nice person. It's simply because they're feeling good about themselves, and want to spread the positivity. 

&nbsp;

People express outwardly what they're experiencing inwardly.

&nbsp;

**Step 3: Build Up Your Own Self-Esteem & Respect**

&nbsp;

Due to your childhood, you may have not gotten a chance to learn from your father how to set boundaries and limitations for people. You weren't taught how to draw a line in the sand for what you'll accept and what you won't put up with from people, because your father destroyed your self-esteem and self-respect through his anger issues.

&nbsp;

This can be fixed.

&nbsp;

In order to build up self-esteem and respect, you'll need to do two things. The second thing will seem ridiculous, but hear me out. I've experienced this shit.

&nbsp;

First, you need to figure yourself out. You need to know what you're comfortable with and uncomfortable with. Though you may not have boundaries at this point and time, you know what bothers you and what you brush off. This applies to social interactions, relationships, friendships, partnerships, etc.

&nbsp;

You need to figure out and develop a system for yourself of what you expect from people. How you expect them to treat you, how you expect them to treat others, and how you expect them to treat themselves. Naturally, you need to practice what you expect from others, but if this is hard for you right now, simply have a basic layout of right and wrong.

&nbsp;

Decide for yourself what behaviors, actions and words are acceptable and right, and which are unacceptable and wrong when it comes to acting, doing and talking to other people. This will be your basis for how you treat other people, and how you expect to be treated by other people.

&nbsp;

Over time, you'll find certain things actually don't bother you, and certain things actually do bother you. As you learn about your boundaries, you can adjust your expectations, as well as your own behavior. Through experience, you'll have a general 'character' for yourself and how you act and talk to people. Those are you boundaries.

&nbsp;

After you've got your boundaries, you need to enforce them, which is the second thing. 

&nbsp;

This doesn't necessarily mean you need to get confrontational whenever someone crosses your boundaries. But it does mean you need to stand up for yourself and what you believe in. If someone calls you out unfairly, defend yourself. If someone disrespects you, stand your ground and call them out on their disrespect. You hold true to your beliefs and stand by them.

&nbsp;

You're going to come across a handful of people that don't like you for challenging them, but you're going to make **many more** friends and allies by showing you stand for something, and don't allow people to walk all over you when they cross the line. This is far more important than just trying to fight everyone that disagrees with you.

&nbsp;

Though, since you're non-confrontational right now, I understand this can be scary. My tip to overcome this, and it's gonna seem weird, but it's to stop masturbating and watching porn.

&nbsp;

I can't explain to you exactly why retaining semen works well with becoming more assertive and confident, but I can guarantee you that if you build boundaries for yourself, and refrain from watching porn and masturbating, the sexual energy you retain in your body will give you increased assertiveness.

&nbsp;

If you don't believe me, don't masturbate for 2 weeks, and take note of how much more 'aggressive' you feel. It's truly something magical.

Nine weeks into dating I went into surgery and when she was getting stonewalled by the nurses station over my state of recovery (hour 10 of what was supposed to be a 4 hour job), she chased my surgeon into a restricted area to get the lowdown. When my hair fell out, she would put on a matching bandana whenever we'd go out together. When I reacted to the post-recovery drugs like 2% of population and emotionally turned into a hormonal pregnant woman, she cooked and cleaned and took care of everything she could. When she noticed how emotionally upset I was that my mother threw out all of my wrestling memorabilia, she tore a strip off of her. When I asked her to marry me she said yes despite being diagnosed with cancer for a second time. 

After grad school, we decided to move back in with our respective parents in advance of the wedding to save some money. 11 days into doing so, I discovered that my parents took out $40k in debt in my name betting that I would die and the debt would die with me so that it would be ""free money"" and so with no job yet (between economy and illness) she asked her parents for me to move in with them. We had a pact that whichever one of us got a real job first, the other would follow.

I *suck* at hand crafting things, but I had 8 months to learn and I did. A *metric ton* of YouTube tutorials later, I sit a small, colorful papercrafted boat in front of her and just say ""I made this with love"". She just gives me a puzzled look, I respond with a smile and walk to my seat.

r/AskMen,"I suffered from erectile dysfunction as a result of anxiety for a while.

You can't even make an attempt if your dick is limp.

So how did I get over this? Prescription drugs. I went to an online pharmacy from overseas, bought myself a hundred bucks worth of boner pills, and boy howdy them shits WORK. Actually only used them four or five times before I didn't need them anymore. Once the dick was convinced that it was doing a fine job, I had the confidence that I could keep going without the pills.

Honestly, it's great. Got a position that your partner really likes but doesn't do much for you? Boner pills will let you power through that. You could dick someone down six ways from Sunday. You could lay pipe while playing Sudoku. Too drunk to fuck? Tripping on LSD? Viagra don't care, viagra finna make your dick HELLA HARD and that's that. Fuckin' life saver."

r/AskMen,"Because in recent generations masculinity has been defined for people by advertisements,  commercials and TV while many male spaces have disappeared.

“ Be strong. Be sharp. Drink a lot, hit on women and never take no for an answer. Don’t show your feelings, don’t talk about your feelings. You’re a man and that’s all you need. Be like this guy, not that guy.”

The problem is outside of a few smaller time shows and moves. This only shows an incomplete view of masculinity. It doesn’t go into the reasoning why you don’t show your feelings or talks about what ways you can express yourself. It doesn’t tell you how to solve personal problems as a man or what are reasonable expectations in certain relationships. Combine this with the erosion of male oriented spaces and the lack of male mentors in a young mans life, and you have a couple generations of men with a skewed perception of how they should “man up” that’s been defined by advertisers and Hollywood writers.

The phrase “man up” originally had the intent in saying “there are things you will have to do in life that are scary or not fun. But as an adult you’ll have to face these things. I’m asking you to face it now because I think you’re ready. Man up.”  It was the punchline in a greater conversation about maturity and facing things head on. It was a label on a conversation, just like people know what kind of conversation “the birds and the bees” is. 

But people cut out he conversation or trimmed it down. Communication between generations got skewed and ideas of respect and honor got thrown out in favor of advertisements and shows that promoted drama and agressiveness.  Now “man up” is seen as a toxic phrase. Something bad parents say to bully their child and for kids to yell at each other to edge each other on. 

I highly recommend the Art of Manliness podcast if you want to learn about masculinity through a non-gender politics lens."

I had this whole speech I was going to tell her and I had started making plans to move so that we could have enough space for the two of us. But then she didn't come back to my apartment where she was staying and didn't show up until the next afternoon.

r/AskMen,"The misunderstood Great White Shark. Those things are so fucking cool, and what I consider the Earths most impressive apex predator. For anyone interested, I am now going to list some cool shit about them:  
\- They trap body heat to allow their muscles to work more effectively in cold waters. Although technically not endothermic, they are almost ""warm blooded"" fish.

\- Great Whites typically strike from behind/below at impressive speeds, hence the videos of them breaching entirely out of the water. Imagine getting hit by a truck with teeth.

\- Despite what some people think, they are not ruthless killers, in fact the are quite intelligent. I read a study that showed White sharks ceasing predatory behaviour once their successful strike rates dropped below a particular level (due to increased daylight). This conserves energy and shows the sharks making decisions to preserve energy.

\- Another study suggested that the sharks are able to 'measure' fat content upon first bite, and then decide whether the follow through is necessary. Keeping in mind the previous point, the sharks will not waste the energy if they think that the prey item is not fatty enough to give them the energy the want. This is a possible reason as to why shark attacks result in the person bleeding out, not actually from the shark finishing them off and attempting to eat them. 

There are so many other cool things about them, I might throw some more up later after I've had a sleep."

No.

Just stop right there. There's such a little chance of her coming-around in the future. Drop your expectations to the ground and start slowly getting over her by surrounding yourself with happy thought, hobbies, and your favorite people. If she were interested, she would have said something along the lines of ""oh... I have feelings for you too"". She MIGHT be shy, MIGHT be coy, MIGHT be shocked and say later on that she's into you but it will most likely not happen. Take your time letting YOURSELF down easily. Having a new crush within a month does not make you a fuck-boy and you should ignore those comments if they appear in the future. If you KNOW you're a nice guy, then that's her loss.

r/AskMen,">How does one make friends similar to childhood friends but as adults?

Do you *remember* how those friendships were formed when you were a kid?

You'd play together, run around together, fall and get hurt together, chase girls together, go through the absolute nightmare that is school together. In a way, your friendships, your *true* friendships, were tempered by hardship.

Sometimes, you're not even totally compatible or have a lot in common with your high school bros, but you'd kill for them, because they were there for you when that girl broke your heart and you were there for them when their abusive parents treated them like absolute garbage. You have *history* together. True bonds pass through fire.

Do you *really* expect to get that with someone you're only willing to have two beers with once a week? Not gonna happen.

Adults don't want to put this much time and effort into creating new bonds. They have jobs that, normally, they hate. They have children to take care of. Spouses to satisfy. And let's be honest here, adults are grumpy assholes.

If you wanna make new friends at the ripe age of 35, you gotta make some sacrifices, man. *And* find people who are willing to do the same."

It's a never ending struggle to balance out my body, being lean and massively muscular.

Funny thing is I don't workout for aesthetics and I don't want to be 225 at 4% body fat like a body builder.

It's been really hard to overcome. I have to take measurements to remind myself objectively I'm muscular while being objectively lean."
r/AskMen,"It's a really good question.

There's a big gap in our culture - well-intentioned but incredibly poorly implemented imho.

Obviously there's a major problem with sexualizing young children and all the nasty groomy shit that lies down that road. But the solution of trying to completely isolate them from all mention of sexuality *right through adolescence* is doomed to either fail, or produce even worse results. That's when they're forming all their ideas and attitudes towards sex, and both *nothing* and fucking Brazzers are equally terrible sources of material, imho.

But since there's almost nothing *in* The Forbidden Zone between the two, it is indeed really hard to give them any kind of middle path to steer.

The Norwegians seem to have a much saner approach to all this. They're far less prudish about nudity and even actual sex; just check out some of the documentaries on NRK. You will see stuff rated *9 years and up* featuring detailed genitalia and actual intercourse. Not porn by any means, just how-stuff-works.

They actually devoted a whole season of a children's science show to puberty and sex-ed, and it got such an amazed response in the US that they released a subtitled version for free on youtube. Search for 'newton pubertet' sometime - it's bright, bubbly, amazingly positive and relentlessly detailed.

You could do a lot worse than showing your kid that - it's far less diagrams-and-condoms than anything made in the states, and it goes a whole lot more into attitudes and treating it as something *normal*, not... fratboy.

Beyond that, talking is good. Talk not just about condoms and consent - talk about the positives too. Talk about shitty attitudes and what makes them shitty. Talk about attraction and desire. Talk about recreational sex and masturbation.  Talk about interactions with social and religious norms, talk about the [Flanderization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) of porn, the exploiting-a-commodity concept that gets bundled into it, and how much is *lost* in the process of turning an important and wonderful part of life into shitty clickbait. (Heh, the shittiness of web ads would make a good analogy, come to think of it.) Talk about flirting, courting, picking up and hooking up. Talk about the middle path between passive niceguy and aggressive sleazeball. Make it a topic of conversation that's welcome *at any level*, at any time (depending who's in earshot, of course). 

Get him media-savvy so he can look at a movie, ad, poster, etc and tell you what they're pushing for him to think, and how they're doing it. Show him tvtropes. Let him see how media influences attitudes, so he's at least *aware* of those attitudes towards sex. Without life-experience to navigate by, at least give him to tools to at least see where the current is taking him."
r/AskMen,"Well I'm a jaded supervillian, bent on wiping out humanity to make way for the lizard people."
r/AskMen,Why not be more assertive and just shake a hand like a regular person lol ... don’t fall into the different hand shake trap !!
r/AskMen,maybe start flirting with her first to see if she’s feeling the same
r/AskMen,By decreasing your emotional resistance.
r/AskMen,"Slow down and think through it. 

I used think that motivation meant being super excited and energetic to do something. Maybe that is what it technically means. But your end goal here is to study, am I right? So, slow down and spend 10 minutes on your bed thinking through why you don't want to study. Feel those disturbing emotions of ""it'll be boring"", ""studying sucks"" and replace them with the truth of ""I'll be much more satisfied if I study"" and ""I can get started for 5 minutes and see what happens"" and ""Hmmm... I actually kind of enjoy studying"" and ""I sure as hell don't want to pull another fricking all-nighter.""  

Calm down and spend 10 minutes thinking through all the bull you're telling yourself. At one point during that thought process, you'll be sparked to open up your books."
r/AskMen,Ok... well done OP. I approve of this.
r/AskMen,"As men, it's what we do. Society doesn't give a fuck about us. Like it or not, we're very expendable. If we don't keep our head up, we fall. Look how many homeless dudes their are and how few safety nets there are for us? I wish I could give you an answer, but I can't. Try to take solace in the fact that I, and many other men, know exactly how you feel. Just drive on brother. You only get one shot at life."

r/AskMen,"I'm 20

My classmate clearly got access to porn at the age of 9 and started talking about it constantly; so the entire class got introduced to porn and thus sex at the age of 9.


Jokes and discussions about it began at about 11 or 12, where a lot of the girls started to develop physically, and my fellow comrades started to notice, thus sex became very topical at the age of 11-12.


Think it is a generational thing. When I was young porn was available online, when you fossils were young it wasn't available to the same degree."
r/AskMen,"If your hobbies deter a women, she isn’t the one for you. I’m into nerdy guys. You just have to find the right person, don’t change or hide who you are"
r/AskMen,"Maybe something to establish a premise that’s different from your real lives? Just to sort of fully create a separate reality.

A bit like that thing in Modern Family where Claire and Phil adopt different names and Phil even wears a name tag sticker on his jacket."
r/AskMen,She just wants attention. She likes having options available rather than the actual option.
r/AskMen,I'd do it. After it had been rigorously tested and proven to be safe. Changing up and having direct input into my brain's nervous system sounds a wee bit risky.
r/AskMen,"Spitting. I've been spit on in a non-sexual way, I have a very negative reaction towards it. I'm disgusted by it."
r/AskMen,"Its time to start over. You have to rediscover who you are without her. It's not easy, and it takes time, but it will get better. 

Right now your top priority is taking care of yourself. Exercise, eat healthy, and sleep well. You may not want to do this but these things will help keep you stable as the chemicals in your body balance back out and they will also make you feel better about yourself. Your mental health is just as important so try meditating, positive self talk, and mindfullness to help get you through the day.

Also, you'll need to start getting yourself back out there. Not dating right away, but just out in public where you can meet people. Join a club, a sports league, or take a class. Find something new that you will enjoy and that will improve your life. This can help you make some new friends and start to find out who you are without your ex.

Start with small steps and don't overwhelm yourself. Forgive yourself for anything you did wrong and don't focus on your ""wasted"" time. Take what you can learn from this and leave it behind. If you haven't already block her out of your life completely. It's hard, but it makes the process much quicker. 

The next couple years are going to be all about you and that's fine. Heart break teaches you alot about yourself so the silver lining here is that in the end this will make you a better person. Build yourself back up and become even better then you were. If I could do it then you definitely can. 

Best of luck going forward man. You can do this."

Just do what you'd regularly do but prepare yourself for rookie mistakes, just keep in mind you're setting the bar for his following relationships."
r/AskMen,"I always wanted kids, but it didn't work out that way.  I was married in my 20s.  We both wanted kids, but didn't get to that point before getting divorced.  The next long relationship I was in was with a woman who couldn't have kids.  

When I met my wife, she already had two kids.  They were teens at the time.  One of them ended up having two children, so I became an insta-grandfather.  I ended up with a wife, two stepdaughters and two grandkids over the course of a few years.  I am really enjoying it, and am very grateful that I ended up as a stepfather and grandfather."

r/AskMen,Nerd shit that I'm interested in. Girls tend to like it when you get excited about something stupid. Seeing how animated you get over something you're obsessed with really makes them wonder how you talk about them.

r/AskMen,"Start trying new things. When you find something you really enjoy and are good at you'll become obsessed with getting better. You'll want to invest time in that instead of dedicating *ALL* your time into a relationship.

Try to focus on living life for you. This will make you more attractive too in that you'll be more confident and always have something to show for or work towards."
r/AskMen,"Communication is the key to any sexual activity. If he isn’t doing it for you or not hitting that magic spot. Don’t say “you’re doing it wrong” try educating him. If he hits that sweet spot, tell him “right there” or “don’t stop”

Keeping communication open about sex outside the bedroom is a good way to a better sex life as well. Tell him things that he does that you like.

One more tip is, guys are very visual creatures. The reason the porn industry is so huge. Straight up, show him what you want.

Doing these things, means you won’t have to lie when you say “THAT was fucking AWESOME!!!”"
r/AskMen,"I keep myself busy, the more you work the more you are distracted. Anxiety is a pretty shitty thing and can cripple people."
r/AskMen,"I want to be in love with someone who loves me back. 

I'd also like to be in a fight that leaves both myself and the other guy with physical scars."
r/AskMen,"Took a public speaking class while I was enlisted in the Marines. I also took a class about preparing resumes which also included lessons about how to prepare college applications.

Once you’re confident in the professional sphere of your life, the social sphere will follow. 

It’s easy to be confident when you’re the one people are going to for advice. When YOU are the expert. 

I’m sure there’s a part of your life you’re very good at and when people ask you questions on that subject you’re at 100% of your potential while explaining it. 

I used to raid hard during the Lich King expansion. I’ve heard anti-social computer nerd types lead 25 people through a 3hr raid better than Marine Corps officers can talk through a simple 5-paragraph order. 

Edit: On that last point. I’ve always had a theory that the best infantry commanders are hidden behind computers playing MMOs. In a future like Ender’s Game, they’ll be the ones saving the world, not the people who can run fast and do lots of pullups. 

And just for some street cred on this post: I’ve been in the Marines for 10yrs and am currently a V-22 Osprey Pilot."
r/AskMen,I'm alive I guess
r/AskMen,"I can be friends with lots of people, but someone I'd date has to be someone I could be *best friends* with.  Considering the amount of time I'm going to spend with her, if the relationship progresses.  It's a much higher bar of compatibility."
r/AskMen,This is sexual harassment.  If reported to the company and it doesn't stop immediately it's a hostile work environment claim.
r/AskMen,"That I didn't realise at the time? My sexuality. I'm straight, so maybe you wouldn't expect it, but growing up with teachers actively trying to keep boys and girls apart (catholic school) and me being a goodie two shoes not wanting to get in trouble was a combo that led me to think that sexual thoughts, flirting, etc. was wrong.

But there were a lot of other ways I was shamed for being a boy at school that even at the time I realised what was going on."
r/AskMen,"yes, go talk to a therapist. no, they won't solve your issues for you, but a good therapist will provide a better perspective and stimuli for you to work with."
r/AskMen,Never
r/AskMen,"You're getting a lot of sarcastic responses which is unfortunate. Manhood and masculinity are being rejected as concepts. People can say being a man is just ""being an adult male"" but men without father figures are far more likely to end up in jail or low income jobs than those who do ( I say this as someone raised by a single mom).  To answer your question my mom saw the value in male role models and she put me in boy scouts. I learned a lot of life lessons from my leadership in scouting. I also had a brother much older than me and he taught me a lot as well. We have to get past thinking anything male centered is negative."
r/AskMen,I'm on the fence about buying another 2 unit apartment building or buying a pontoon boat. Things could be worse
r/AskMen,I just say thanks and silently disbelieve them.
r/AskMen,That is like the biggest male fantasy ever. Why is there no porn where this happens?
r/AskMen,"Realizing that I am not a failure or screw-up, I have only failed and screwed-up. Don't assume making a mistake says anything about who you are as a person. The person who never fails is a person who never takes chances or does anything outside their comfort zone. It's a shitty way to live life."
r/AskMen,You're pretty much firing on all cylinders as it is mate
r/AskMen,I tell my wife to mind her own business.
r/AskMen,"I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2011 after years of physical and mental abuse by my parents. Even a an attempt to kill me by my grandfather.  

After Diagnosis I was placed in a PTSD therapy program. It changed my life. It was almost a year long and help me understand, help me cope with new things, and start my life over. You already have a strong head on your shoulders by your words. You are not alone in this struggle. 

If you ever want to chat about this message me. I have no problem talking about openly to help others understand PTSD, and know they are not alone in their struggles."
r/AskMen,"I like feeling like I am important to someone, and that her romantic focus is on me. I like knowing them deeply and having bonds of attachment that make going through hard times more bearable, and sharing joyful times more pleasant. I like pooling our resources and becoming a team to face life without any other relationship distractions. I like the feeling of belonging, of having someone who's more special to me than anyone else. I like the exclusivity of sex, sharing everything with them and exploring things together, giving and receiving body and pleasure as something reserved only for them.

Sure, novelty and conquest are fun and part of me wants that, but it's a very small part compared to the rest of me and that makes me see monogamy as a very desirable arrangement for meeting my needs and desires."
r/AskMen,"Drinking, masturbation and video games."

r/AskMen,Either shes old fashioned or shes a taker and not a giver. Either way use your big boy words and address this with her.
r/AskMen,"Life seems pretty meaningless sometimes. I go to work at a boring job, come home, eat dinner, watch tv, go to sleep, and then do it all over again. Occasionally it is broken up with more exciting things but 75% of my life seems to be this somewhat meaningless ritual."
r/AskMen,I put on a suit and take my wife out to dinner. My wife loves me in a suit and she loves getting all dolled up. She showers me with compliments every time I do it and I love it.
r/AskMen,"Usually I use her name but I say ""my love"" sometimes. 

Like if she calls me into a room I'll say ""Yes, my love?""

Seems fine when I say it but I'm cringing so hard typing it lol."
r/AskMen,"It was fine, actually. She was really cool, open and honest about her feelings and was very understanding that I didn't reciprocate. We never talked about it again, but we're still really good friends. She has a girlfriend now, actually. They seem to have a pretty awesome relationship.

It was definitely better than the other time I decided to give it a shot instead. It was a messy ending, our friendship was never the same after that and she now has a fiancé who ""doesn't allow"" her to talk to me ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
r/AskMen,"So, my husband has a lower sex drive than I do. I would love it 5-7x per week, realistically he wants it 2x per week. We were 20 when we got married, we had no real idea what our libidos were like and how important compatibility is. Anyway....it’s hard and has been a struggle. Still is a struggle, but here’s what’s helped so far: 
1. Exercise, diet, overall good health 
2. Lifting weights 
3. Going to bed at the same time every night. 
4.  No underwear rule in bed
5. When I can tell he’s tired and having a bad day, I’m disappointed so I try to take care of myself before he gets home. And make it known that I did, I’m good, we can just cuddle and relax tonight. 
6. He literally keeps track of how often we have sex so he makes sure to make it a priority often enough. Since his body naturally only wants it half as much, he makes a conscious effort to connect when he otherwise wouldn’t. 

Like I said, it’s still a struggle for us. Probably always will be. But we’re trying to make it work and it has gotten easier and more satisfying for both of us"

Diet plays a HUGE role. Pineapple/water diets help. Smoking and bad diet doesn't.

Worst experience is a tangy onion smell of a crotch that is obviously not taken care of. Screw going down, it can disconnect you from the actual sex.

- do all I can to look my very best

- work on confidence, charisma and basically everything else"

r/AskMen,Talk to me like they used to. Don't be so cold and distant.
r/AskMen,"Have absolutely no idea how to make romantic advances, but it’s damn easy to talk and become friends with em. Sigh"
r/AskMen,"Depends on the time frame. If it's a quick long distance I could put up with it, but if it's a year long separation either someone is going to have to make a move to the other, or I would have to consider ending the relationship. 

In my experiences, LDRs are very tough to maintain."
r/AskMen,"By accepting that change and getting better aren't straight paths, neither are they sudden changes in state. Also, creating new and healthy habits and forming new mindsets is hard work.

I started doing small things, that would make me feel better, or were healthy for me. Starting off with the smallest thing, like cleaning up my flat and decorating it. Or going to one more social meeting per month than usual. Going for one extra walk. Eating more vegetables twice a week.

And not beating myself up over not doing super well right away. Or for having ""off"" days.

Also, I studied my ass off, when it came to reading books about mental health.

In 2.5 years, I went from anxiety, depression, insomnia and a general lack of success to the opposite."

r/AskMen,"When I got into shape and generally improved my life, I found I enjoyed the lifestyle and would have continue even if it didn't have any benefits to my appearance and health. I love riding my bike and sitting with a cup of tea to read a book instead of slamming beers and watching TV. It makes me generally happy, and while I'm sure websites list that as ""mood improvement"" or whatever, the idea of being just in a good mood is so glossed over but is actually an effect of a healthier lifestyle."
r/AskMen,Gold bond body powder. Also trim the pubes and body hair.  Hair traps heat and moisture leading to more odor.  Also wear clothes with good absorbent properties.
r/AskMen,"I hooked up with a girl in college who, at first, seemed absolutely infatuated with me. Showed up at my dorm randomly, always wanted to meet up between classes and just hang out 24/7. On the night we finally hooked up she stayed over and shot out first thing in the morning before I woke up. I text her a few times with no reply.


A week later she text me asking to “cuddle”"

r/AskMen,"One of my best and most wonderful friends committed suicide. (We were in the Marines together). My other friend, (we all three served together), came to my room and we just hugged and cried for what felt like forever. I've never grasped onto another man as hard as I did that day.

r/AskMen,"Well I didn’t even do anything wrong, and 7 years later I just can’t motivate myself to care for wasting my time and energy on anyone else again. Sometimes it’s best to just have your own back and not bother with anyone else."
r/AskMen,"I also think that even asking the same questions but from a different perspective is an easy and effective way to break the monotony. Instead of asking “how was your day” ask “what was your favorite part of your day”. You cold ask specific questions about the person’s day, like if they work in customer service, ask who their best/worst customer was and why. 

Just think of questions that can’t be easily answered with a one or two word sentence, and that can help."

r/AskMen,"It's going extremely well. Been seeing this girl for about 7 weeks and she is amazing. Beautiful, interesting, outgoing, caring. I'm quite smitten. I'm inclined to say she's out of my league, but she keeps telling me things like I'm the best sex she's ever had, the nicest guy she's ever met, the most positive person she knows. We make plans for weeks in advance. She mentioned me to her family and wanted to meet mine (she didn’t meet them, that’s a bit too soon for me, but it was a nice thought). I've met all her friends. She asked me if I want to vacation with her to Florida over the summer. I get the feeling she's going to ask me to be her date to her sister's wedding in July. 

I feel really good about this girl. We haven't dropped boyfriend/girlfriend/relationship labels yet, but have established exclusivity and I feel really confident about it."

r/AskMen,"It was a huge surprise to me. I was scared about what it meant for them, but totally committed to being supportive and making sure they knew there was nothing wrong with what they were feeling and who they are.

I did feel an odd sense of loss for a son I no longer had. And then I felt guilt for feeling that grief. I’ve heard others who have articulated similar, illogical emotional reactions. I got over the grief after a week or two. I still feel guilt about having that reaction.

Edit: I also feel very proud of my child for having the courage and self awareness to tell us, and for being proud of who they are."

One day I decided I'd just start being a little more forward and expected - rather than feared - that I'd be rejected.

They don't want to look desperate or pushy or clingy, and they become paralyzed to the point where they don't make it clear that they are interested.

r/AskMen,"If you want your marriage to work, you and your spouse have to work as a team, not as individuals. Marriage is fundamentally about becoming a unit and operating with each other's best interests in mind for a common goal. 

That doesn't mean you lose your individuality, it means you must care about one another enough to cherish doing things together, but also allowing each other to do the things you love by yourself.

You also have to value doing things with your kids, but also value doing things without them.

People who refuse to actual do things with their kids but also fail to go on dates/vacations without their kids will quickly burn out because everything becomes about merely getting through the day/week/year.

You'll burn out and resent one another. 

You also have to shift priorities around when kids and a spouse come into the picture...example.

I love lifting weights. Before kids when my wife worked night shifts I could easily go to the gym after work for 2-3 hours. Still had me time..

Now with kids (and valuing spending time with them and my wife) I wake up at 5am to workout."

r/AskMen,"I've written a few words for funerals that have gone over well. Be genuine; don't use placid, watery language, but recall specific aspects of his character or specific good memories of you and him. Use language you'd actually use - you don't have to bust out the thesaurus. Don't hide your sadness and loss, but include heartwarming fondness and even some humour if you can. Speak from the heart but don't waffle or rant. Structure it a little. End on something good - a quote, a final poignant message or word etc. The speech will feel complete and wrapped up, and might help give a sense of closure to the event.

I'm sorry for your loss and I hope that by writing a good speech you can find some resolution. I'd be happy to give you more specific help via DM if you like."
r/AskMen,"Get a work out in.  Eat a snack, something not heavy but it'll hold me over.  Lay out some clothes. Shower. Brush teeth, mouthwash. Change. Change clothes again because I think I look retarded or I'm over doing it.  Change again because maybe I'm not overdoing it, maybe I should look nice and don't want to seem overly casual.  Mouthwash again because somehow in my mind in the time it took me to get changed and ready, my breath got funky.  Triple check that I had my wallet and phone and check again when I get to my car in case I somehow lost it on my way to the car."

r/AskMen,"Mrs. Anderson and I had a great first year of marriage during which we occupied ourselves with a lot of the following:

* Refer to each other as ""husband"" or ""wife"" and giggle at how ridiculous it sounded
* Sorting out how we wanted to share finances
* European vacation
* Hunting for and buying our first home
* Playing with our first doggie
* Working on a new business
* Learning how to invest in real estate

I can count on zero fingers the number of times that Mrs. Anderson or I have threatened separation over the past 25 years.

r/AskMen,"There was this span of 3 days where I hung out a lot with the girl I had been dating for almost 5 months. Honestly, I felt like she could be the one. The first day we had a great day hanging out at my place. The second day we biked around the lake and at the end, she gave me a gift. I was working night shifts (driver) and had trouble falling asleep during the day so she gave me a sleeping mask and a good-luck charm which said: ""may you be safe wherever you go"". It was wrapped in this super cute wrapping paper too. At that point, I felt so happy and in love. 

&#x200B;

On the third day, she broke up with me, telling me how she saw her ex walking with his new girlfriend and realized that she didn't have those same feelings for me."
r/AskMen,"I guess that means you're 25 now, right?

I like to ask girls about the kind of music they're into, or if they like going to concerts. Asking about jobs, career prospects, what they wanna do with themselves, since everyone I'm dating is kinda about college age, or just finished college. 

Shows they watch, what they do with their free time. If they make art, or think they make art. How they occupy their time, and the sort or things they like have strong opinions about. Then I like to ask speculative things like, whats your dream pet and what would you name them? What do you wanna do in 10 years and where do you want to live? What do you want your life to look at at 50? Just shit to discuss."

She started with just a full body shot, fully clothed, nothing out of the ordinary.  She does it alot as a ""hi, hope your day is awesome""  kind of thing.  But like every like 15-20 min, I got another, and each one was progressively more revealing because she was stripping down in her bathroom at work.  She was wearing some lingerie and had some toys with her.  The last one was on my bed full nude. 

IT WAS AN AWESOME FUCKING DAY."

20 year old brother: we talk all the time via snapchat and instagram messaging. not many phone calls or facetimes, but we're inseparable when we're both home or on vacation with our family.

19 year old sister: she used to be super bitchy as a younger teen, but she's very cool now. we have a lot of similar interests that we talk about. we talk over snapchat and on the phone a few times a week.

18 year old sister: i see her a bit more since she lives at home, so we dont ever talk on the phone really. we're both into the same tv shows and music so we bond over that

17 year old brother: he's one of my best friends. we've always been very, very close. we talk every day, play video games together, and discuss everything from our relationships, school, drinking/smoking/partying (me preaching for him to be smart but have fun). 

Different relationships with all of them, but we're close in different ways."
r/AskMen,"I'm ashamed of this but when I was 15 I met some girl online and started messaging on MSN.

She lived in another country yet I still pretended to be older than I was because she was 19. 

We chatted a lot (typical m'lady stuff that a 15 y/o would say).

Eventually she started to like me which gave me a huge ego boost. But then I felt bad for her because I was lying about my age. So I pretended that I fell in love with a girl in my school and told her that we should go separate ways.

I was deeply in love. I saw my life with her, and all of that blinded me.

r/AskMen,[In Da Club by 50 Cent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUeaAOIAbXs)
r/AskMen,"I was in a similar situation. 5'9 weighing in at 124 lbs. Gym was offering a $0 sign up membership so I just started one day. The trainers there told me everything I needed to know. 8 months later I'm at 144 lbs, and most of that gain has been muscle. I probably could have gained another 5 by now but I skipped a couple of months.

&#x200B;

Construct a routine by talking to the trainers at the gym. This is the answer to your first and second questions.

&#x200B;

You can google about gym etiquette. It really isn't rocket science or anything.

&#x200B;

Most people will tell you that you should aim for at least 3 days of strength training a week, but you can easily do 5 if you do legs twice a week and 3 days of upper body training (Back/tricep, chest/bicep, shoulder, or something like that).

&#x200B;

Your diet should consist of a high amount of carbohydrates, as well as proteins (aim for at least 125-150 grams a day, which sounds crazy but really is not that much if you try). Your fat consumption should be moderate. Don't forget to eat fruits and vegetables as well. Watch for food with high amounts of sugar.  The daily sugar limit is about 37.5 grams for men, which is very easy to pass. Check this page out for more info on sugar:  [https://www.glycemicindex.com/](https://www.glycemicindex.com/). Nutrition is an incredibly important component of gaining muscle. You should be consuming around 3000 calories a day.

&#x200B;

Many people will tell you about how they gained 10-20 pounds of pure muscle in like 2 or 3 months. I am here to tell you that that is bullshit. It is impossible. Gaining muscle is a slow process, but if you really train hard (5 times a week) and eat well, you should notice a significant difference in how you look in 3 months. If you want to look like Cris Hemsworth or something, then you are looking at at least 1 or 2 years. It sounds like a lot ,but once you start going to the gym on a daily basis, you will find that it will become a part of your life."

r/AskMen,"I work with teenagers who exibit at risk behaviours and if there is one thing I've learned it's that they we *always* wear what they want. Whether you like them to or not, or whether you know they do or not. 

If you ""force"" your daughter to wear something different (and let's be honest, that will only be a thing around you) you are forcing her to hide something from you. If you begin to police her life more, she will hide more from you.

&#x200B;

Third time: she had a boyfriend back home but was in desperate need of some dick. We were both drunk so I agreed. By the time we got to her place I sobered up a bit and felt it'd be wrong to proceed. I sometimes still doubt if that was the right decision."

r/AskMen,"I'm Asian. To generalise a bit. The girls I date that grew up in a western country, generally don't care too much. They just want you to be able to support yourself.

The ones I date that grew up in Asia? Wealth matters very much. They expect you to be the sole provider in the household. It's not a case of being a stay at home mum, they want you to fund their travels and provide an allowance. Hopefully it's a traditional view that's changing."

r/AskMen,"Walk away if possible. If it is a stranger (someone you will likely never see again), you will not resort to fighting and it will defuse because you will never see them again.  If it is a friend (or family, etc), it gives you a chance to cool off and talk to them later with a level head."
r/AskMen,"Typically you start to sense that you don't have much in common anymore, so you start reaching out less. Then, if they're interested in maintaining the friendship, they'll either consciously or subconsciously start reaching out more to compensate. If that happens, and they're reaching out and clearly care about what's going on in your life, it's a sign that there's probably still something there and it's worth hanging on to. But if they keep reaching out just to talk about themselves, or if they don't reach out to compensate at all, you can just let them go their way and you go yours."

Who says they don't? If you're good friends for a long time, some feelings might develop, that's life, that's nature. Set concrete boundaries, ""real"" friends will be cool with it, the others won't matter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Setting boundaries early helps; treating them specifically like they treat each other can also have a nullifying affect on emotional/relationship-ish attraction to you.

If you want the adventure then ya I'm sure Vegas would be a great place to try out. If you're looking for a relaxing time, try finding a national park, that has cabins to rent for the week. That way your still close enough attractions that you can go out and socialize, but can still stay in your element if you need an escape."

You have to realize that others -- even your SO -- don't always look at life from the same perspective as you and a couple has to bridge that gap to stay successful. When you have an argument and believe you are standing up for yourself, do so in a way that is conducive to her seeing YOUR perspective.

Then the industry went through a lull and I was laid off. It became immediately clear that being a workaholic was not what I wanted in my life. The next position I took I treated in a much more balanced manner so I could focus more on social life, hobbies, sleep, things like that. No more 80+ hour weeks. Hell, I don't even work 50+ hour weeks more than once or twice a year now.

This approach has made me infinitely happier and healthier. So although not focused on marriage, right around 30 is when I went, nah, life is too short to spend the whole thing trying to get a bigger paycheck."

10 years later I was around 190.  Ate like a horse, literally anything I wanted in mass quantities.  But I worked 12/7 in a pretty hard job.

In the last 10 years I went from a manufacturing job on the floor, to the office, and became very sedentary and gained another 120+ pounds since my eating habits didn't change to go with it.

I'm now back down to around 275 (after hitting 320 at one point), and losing fast since I've decided that being fat sucks compared to when I was skinnier.  I'll be happy if I can get back to under-200."

r/AskMen,"If she always knows what you're doing, before you say it.

I dated a girl once who *always* knew what I was up to. She wouldn't protest, mind you, but the fact that she *knew* would always creep me out. Every now and then I'd get texts like: ""Are you taking so long to reply 'cause you're with your friends, right? It's okay, I don't mind 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊""

Or even ""how's your beer? I know how much you like \[exact brand I'm drinking\] 😊😊😊😊😊""

She'd always get super passive aggressive when it took me too long to respond to a text, though. She would *always* reply straight away, even really late at night. Couple that with the fact that she tracked my every move, it kind of made me feel like she didn't do anything else in her life, besides seek my attention.

It was weird, yo.

I don't have any form of social media either (besides Reddit), so I've always wondered how she'd figure out what I was up to. When I pressed her about it, she'd just say ""a girl can't reveal all her secrets 😊😊😊😊😊😊"" . Yikes.

Just being open to invitations from the people I met in my first year made me far more social, so I'd suggest that at first, always say yes to everything. You should also make plans with the new people you meet, it doesn't have to be fancy, even so much as hanging out at your house/room is enough to get things rolling"

r/AskMen,"Feel free to visit those of us in /r/bipolar2, it's a supportive community.

I'm newly diagnosed but I've been dealing with the symptoms for a very long time. I use a combination of medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, good habits, lots and lots of data, and self-awareness. It's a defense in depth. Each one is a layer and a safety net. 

## Medication

Mood stabilizers reduce the highs and lows. If you start slipping, you might need to get some medications adjusted. Recommend having a specialist for this.

Antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds can deal with depression or anxiety that can come from bipolar.

## Cognitive behavioral therapy

Helps combat negative thoughts. If I know I'm getting stuck in circles of bad or stressful thoughts, I pull out a worksheet and spend 15 minutes identifying what's wrong with my thinking and come up with positive thoughts to counteract the bad. It doesn't make depression and anxiety go away but it does lighten my burden significantly.

The book I'm learning this from is called [The Feeling Good Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Handbook-David-Burns/dp/0452281326). I strongly recommend having a therapist as a guide.

## Good Habitats

I go to sleep at the same time every night, as much as possible. Sleep is absolutely critical to maintaining stability, so I make it a priority.

Routines are extremely helpful when you're not 100%. Relying on your brain's autopilot really helps. If you're not too depressed, keep up your exercise.

My best habit is to not let failure stop me. I have bipolar, I will fail and I will fail hard. Failure does not mean I give up. If I can salvage a victory, I better damn well try. This mental illness will not control me.

## Lots and lots of data

On my phone, I have a [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) (stored in Apple Notes) and a mood tracker (Daylio app). Both of these things help me get stuff done and keep track of my life. Every important detail of my day is recorded. Every month I review both of these and look for patterns. What are things that affect me? How can I make my life better? And most importantly, what good things have I done?

This last one is critical to my success. There are so many good things my memory misses. Bipolar lies to me and tells me I'm worthless. My journal tells me I'm awesome.

I also use calendar alerts and timed reminders, to combat my time blindness. 

## Self-awareness

This is where routine, good habits, and data meet. Because I'm constantly checking and measuring myself, I always know what mood I'm in. I know what I'm capable of in each mood. 

I know that when I'm manic, I overestimate my own ability. So my good habit is not allowing myself to commit to anything beyond what I can handle when I'm mildly depressed. I allow myself 1 weekly obligation outside work plus 3 bi-weekly ones.

If I'm heading into depression, I cut everything optional from my schedule and buckle down for a long, difficult road. I plan to do a lot of housework and reading. I plan meals with good friends at least once a week so I don't isolate myself.  

This is a lot of trial and error but eventually you figure out what works and what doesn't. 

## How I feel today

Right now, I feel really good and I'm thinking that I don't need meds or therapy anymore. THAT IS A LIE. Routine saves me. I am not allowed to skip meds or therapy homework because I don't think I need them. I have seen what happens to my uncle when he skips meds. It's not pretty. I WILL NOT BE HIM.

Treating bipolar is like treating diabetes: take your meds, sleep, and eat right. Do not ever think you will not have it. It is life long and requires constant maintenance. The good news is it gets easier."
r/AskMen,"> Men in LTR, how often do you have sex

On average once a day. Doesn't mean ""every day"" - some days there's none, some days we go at it more - but overall the moment of intimacy in the morning has been pretty consistent for us.

> how often you'd like to?

I'm fine with that, I'm no longer a teenager but not yet a geezer.

> what is the length of your relationship

22 yrs.

> What do you think the reason behind the difference is?

Historically, both our sex drives have fluctuated over time and sometimes she's been ahead, and sometimes I have been. It really does change constantly.

The most important reason for there being not much of a difference despite that is that we both experience sex primarily as a function of emotion and intimacy. So it's less about feeling randy and needing release most of the time than about wanting to feel emotionally connected.

The other reason is that neither of us believe that rejection is good for the relationship, so we've always taken care to accommodate each other."

r/AskMen,"When I got into my first relationship at 19, my ex was a mess.

&nbsp;

She had BPD, anxiety, depression, was suicidal, had been sexually abused throughout her childhood, and had around 19 sexual/romantic partners by the time we got together.

&nbsp;

She was 18.

&nbsp;

I had gradually learned all these things over time, but I had it in my head that I could fix her somehow. That I'd be the guy to treat her better. Be the guy she's never had, and show her love that she's never felt before. I was the typical 'White Knight"" in shining armor.

&nbsp;

I made **many** mistakes. Trying to fix her in the first place was one of them. Lacking general trust in her was another. Trying to force her to love herself and improve her self image was yet another. I'd try to keep her from her male friends, because I didn't trust them around her, or her around them when she was going through a manic episode.

&nbsp;

The relationship was filled with drama, fighting, suicide attempts, gas lighting, and breakups. Many, many, **MANY** breakups.

&nbsp;

**Failure in Relationships**

&nbsp;

Failure in relationships can be harder to grasp than failure in school, work or platonic relationships, because emotions are highly involved when it comes to romantic relationships. You dedicate part of your life to this person, and build the relationship on the belief that this person loves you like you love them.

&nbsp;

When things end badly, it's not just the relationship that's ruined, it's your present belief and self image that was built during the period of the relationship. The belief that you loved each other. The belief that you'd be able to overcome any adversity. The belief that you won't ever find someone like them.

&nbsp;

Failure in relationships are hard to overcome, because you lose the 'relationship' version of yourself once it's over. And depending on how long the relationship was, a lot of people forget their single selves and fully dedicate to becoming their 'relationship' selves. So in a way, failure in relationships equals failure and the breaking of who you thought you were.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**The Regrets of Breakups**

&nbsp;

As I'm sure you've head before, people tend to look at the past through rose tinted glasses. They reminisce on the good times, and the bad times don't seem so bad when you're faced with the consequences of your/their decision. 

&nbsp;

Loneliness.

&nbsp;

You begin to look back on past events, and more importantly, your own decisions and actions in those past events. You begin to wonder what could have happened if you were a little more patient. A little more loving. A little more caring and understanding. 

&nbsp;

All your failures and mistakes come to a head, and you wish things could have been different. So you regret how things ended. You believe that things could have ended differently, where the two of you could still be happy in the relationship that was. And ever so slightly, you believe that you can still salvage the beliefs you held while in the relationship. You hope you can still save your 'relationship' self from dying.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**Overcoming Failure**

&nbsp;

When it comes to overcoming failure, you've got to do one of the hardest things first. And that's accepting that things ended for a reason. 

&nbsp;

A lot of people fall into the trap of reconciling due to loneliness and hopes of salvaging what was. Others fall deeper and fool themselves into believing that they need the person, or that they'll never find someone better than their ex. It's a tragic cycle.

&nbsp;

When it comes to breakups, you've got to remove yourself from emotion and think logically for a moment. Things ended for a reason. Either you weren't happy with something, or your partner wasn't happy with something. That unhappiness was so great, that one of you, or both of you, felt it was better to end the relationship rather than try to overcome the issue.

&nbsp;

That's important.

&nbsp;

A boundary was passed. Something was broken. Something needed to be fixed. When you're met with failure, all that means is that something you were trying wasn't working. That can be a personal project, dating advice, relationships, career choices, diets, workout plans, it doesn't matter. **Failure means something isn't working**.

&nbsp;

When something isn't working, it means you need to correct/adjust/fix the issue. That sometimes means breaking up with the person when it comes to failures in relationships. Sometimes two people are so incompatible, that the best option is to break up, separate, and see other people.

&nbsp;

Sometimes a failure in a relationship can be fixed through communication and time, but correcting a failure in a relationship requires two very mature individuals that have healthy self esteems and self respect for themselves and their partner. Those qualities aren't too abundant in most relationships.

&nbsp;

In the case the two individuals don't have the ability to communicate effectively, it's best to walk away. The pain will be there. It will hurt. But the pain will be far less through breaking up than it'll be through trying to force things to remain as they are. This will only give rise to resentment, pettiness and insecurity.

&nbsp;

Breakups allow both parties to go their separate ways, heal in their own way, and potentially try again in the future if both are willing and able.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**Failure Ins't The End**

&nbsp;

Failure never means the end to something. It just means the end to a certain approach or certain way you were doing something. Failure doesn't mean give up and never try again. Failure means try a different way.

&nbsp;

So don't give up, whether you're met with failure in another relationship, school, work, friendships or personal endeavors. Simply adjust and continue forward."

With the woman I love(d) however.. I love absolutely everything. It truly is a treat every single time. It feels like we become truly one and I want nothing but her and to please her. To seal this love we have and lose ourselves in each other. I normally never care too much for the PiV sex itself but with her I don't want it to end. I want time to stand still and only care about her. My troubles flow away and all I see is her eyes and all I want to feel is her body against mine. I love the foreplay, I love the cuddling afterwards. Ofcourse I feel dirty, because of the sweating. But I love this kind of dirty. It's what I happily signed up for and I dont want to get rid of it right away. I want to just lay with her and not care about anything. I loved the look in her eyes and fucking hell I miss her :("

For the next 10 years or so, whenever this girl and I were both single, we went at it like rabbits. We became really close friends, and we helped each other through some very rough times.

The ""benefits"" part of our relationship ended when her depression led her down a dark path, and she got pretty deep into drugs."

r/AskMen,"I would say the biggest thing in being well dressed is the fit of your clothes. If you're just getting started in your career and can't yet afford custom shirts, try different brands and different cuts to find the ones that fit you the best.

For instance a lot of people need slim fit shirts opposed to classic fit which tends to be baggy.

I personally like spread or semi spread collars opposed to traditional( for button up shirts).

If you want to be conservative stick more to blues rather than bright colors.

Check out ctshirts.com they have good quality stuff and good deals periodically.

Sure I watch porn and jerk off etc, but I don't really fantasise about fucking other women I meet IRL or fantasize about porn when I'm not watching it. I only fantasize with any kind of elaborate detail about my wife and that's usually to come up with new things to try or old things we haven't played with recently - it's kinda like imaginative planning for later realisation? But even that's not something I do super regularly if I'm honest. When I get horny, I just initiate sex or jerk off if my wife isn't around - the rest of the time my mind is usually occupied elsewhere."

I love that she cries, even though she thinks its stupid, she does the feeling for both of us and I love that she can be vulnerable like that when she sees something touching. She compliments me and talks about how she feels lucky to be with me (I feel the same). She is always honest and does a good job communicating her needs and feelings. Lastly, she's hot and amazing in the sack!"

r/AskMen,"Counseling changed my life. No exaggeration. It took me from a rock-bottom sorry excuse for a boy into a person I can honestly say I'm very proud of. It's hard, and you're going to have to work hard--it's not like cold medicine where you can just take it and feel better. You're gonna have to do what they say and work relentlessly to improve yourself. It's extraordinarily worth it. Most worthwhile thing I've ever done.

r/AskMen,"was chatting up Wilma Flintstone at a Halloween party last year. Eventually, she asked if I wanna leave and go to a bar or something instead. Course I’m like ‘sure, another drink or two can’t hurt’. We get our drinks and prepare to depart. She then asks if I wanted to go to a friend of her’s first and hang out because they were also throwing a “party”. I’m pretty hammered by this point so I’m like YEEAAA¡ We get there. There’s like 3 people just chilling; a couple making out on the couch, completely unaware anyone was around and a guy in the corner smoking a blunt. She tells me to just hang out for a bit while she goes to the bathroom. Bear in mind, at this point my phone is dead as fuck; so I’m just sitting in this living room, dressed as Bob Ross, watching a couple eat each other and trying not to make eye contact with the highest motherfucker this world has ever seen. Eventually the girl comes back, and says that we are gonna chill and wait a few minutes for her friend (I’m thinking I’m getting a 2 for 1 deal here so I’m ecstatic). 
3 minutes later, Wilma is sound asleep, the couple are still going at it, homie in the corner is still working on what is apparently the largest bleezy in history, and my phone is still dead. 2 people enter the house, we exchange awkward ‘sups’, and I realize that this is how my night ends.

Kiss her, pull back, look at how cute her lips are again, kiss them again, pull back again lol. Kiss bottom lip only, top lip only. Enjoy each individually ya know? Part her lips with my thumb and just... I don’t know, enjoy it! Enjoy her. It’s not about making it whether you’re a good kisser or not. If you like the way she looks and feels and you’re absorbing that with your eyes and skin and touch and all that, you’re gonna be a good kisser by default."

r/AskMen,"In the US, tipping in restaurants was initially seen as an unethical bribe for favorable treatment and was looked down upon. Then Prohibition came in and without alcohol sales, restaurant profits took a nosedive. Unable to pay their employees, restaurant owners had to accept the gratuity payments that they had previously disdained.

And there *is* a growing trend of restaurants that don't ask for gratuity and build in the price of labor into the menu prices. But it's slow since most restaurants have no incentive to cut into their already razor thin margins."

r/AskMen,"Someone asked this the other day and I'm just gonna repost my comment. 

""I've got my own approach to giving head. All women like something different. One of the best things you can do is communicate with her. If I'm going down on someone new, I always tell them ""If I'm doing something you like, don't hesitate to tell me to not stop"". Some women are shy of saying things, but opening that line of communication is good. You wanna figure out what she's into and keep doing that, whether it's rough, soft, fast, or slow. Some women like being fingered, some absolutely do not. Find out.

When I'm planning on going down on a woman, it always starts with lots of making out. Good kissing is the best precursor to getting her aroused. You don't wanna just get down there dry unless she just directs you to go for it.

Kiss for a while, touch each other all over. Grab her ass and make her feel wanted. Good head is backed by enthusiasm. After some solid, good kissing, move onto her neck, her ears. You should be touching her thighs, her ass, her breasts, all over as this is going on. One of my favorite moves, if we're on the bed and my hand is up her shirt and she's beneath me, I slowly move down to kiss her stomach and her body. Pulling her shirt up and kissing her breasts. Assuming you're doing a good job, this should all go smoothly, and most often she helps remove the bra at this point. If she doesn't help, I ask if it's cool to remove it and it's basically always a yes.

What you're doing is building her up. This is key.

After playing around with her nipples and breasts, slowly start kissing down her body. I love kissing around the belly button, across her hips, her sides, and right at the center beneath above her waistline. Now you can start taking off her pants. I like to keep kissing around her hips. It may or may not be your choice if the underwear comes off at this point. She may just let you remove everything, she might tear it all off herself, or maybe just the pants. Either way, kiss her legs and inner thighs, making your way towards her pussy. If she's wearing underwear, I love kissing it over anyways, pulling her legs up, and slowly kissing her pussy though the underwear. She should be quite wet if you're doing this all correctly. Take the panties off. If they're off, keep kissing her lips.

Now for actually giving head.

OH AND DISCLAIMER. If you've got stubble at this point, it's not going to be your friend. Make sure you're nice and clean shaven or your beard has grown out a bit at this point. I've been in one situation where I was rocking some rough stubble, and it bothered her to the point where we had to end it all because it was too prickly and hurting her. Don't do that.

NOW for actually giving head. It doesn't all have to be in the tongue. The tongue helps, but I find it's better farther along in giving head once she's gotten real into it. Using your lips is key. Specifically, the inner parts of your lips. Kissing and slowly sucking on her clip and lips should be like sucking the top off of soft serve ice cream. You're being gentle and not using the most outer part of your lips. All of her pussy is sensitive, and kissing her lips all over and getting her clit at the same time is going to drive her crazy. After a little bit of that, I like to slowly lick from the base of her vagina, up to her clit, and then start circling around it. She might tell you to continue doing any of this things, and if so, don't fucking stop if she tells you not to stop. If you're still on the clit, the ""ABC"" rule comes into play. We've all heard that spelling the ABC's with your tongue is a great way of stimulating the clit, and it is to an extent. Some girls like lots of up and down, some like fast left and right. Some love the circling. Try it all and find what pattern works the best. Stick with the best one.

Once you have a solid rhythm going on, you can switch it up. I like to get a little freaky and stick my tongue into her vagina. This may be a little surprise to them, but I've never had a bad response to it. I alternate that and licking/sucking on her clit. If you're not down for that, make sure your goddamn hands are washed and your fingernails are clean, and slide a finger in her while you're licking her clit. Again, if all is going well, she will love this. Hit her g-spot while you're getting her clit and start building speed. If you're going at this for a while, hopefully she's getting close. If she's about to cum, keep doing what you're doing. Don't change it up. Getting a woman to cum comes from keep doing whatever the fuck you're doing. Unless you're like me, who knows what he's doing, teasing them by slowing down when they're close, and then building back up is a good way of driving them absolutely fucking crazy. Now, hopefully you've gotten to a point where you can stay consistent and make her cum. Don't forget, once she has came, slowly take your fingers out of her, move on up, and kiss her gently. Cuddle her. That's important, and is going to make her see that you give a fuck about pleasing her, and will make her want to see you again.

Now if you're like me, and you have TMJ, your jaw is gonna be in a little to a lot of pain at some part in the middle of giving head. I like to take breaks while I'm fingering her (if she like's fingering). Never decide to stop if she's getting too close, that's just an asshole move. If I really need to stop, I make sure it's at a steady point and I politely say I just gotta rest for a moment, they're always cool with it. Unless they yell don't stop, then you fucking power through that shit bro. I've given head for like 15 minutes before, face is gonna hurt eventually though. But, if I'm fingering her and giving my jaw some rest, I like to kiss her thighs and clit gently. Lets me close my jaw, relax my face muscles.

Hope this helps."""

r/AskMen,"Old-as-dirt copypasta alert: 

My wife was incredibly shy when we first met. Once she was comfortable with somebody she would open up and be engaging and incredibly bright and charming, but it took a long time of warming up to get that side of her to come out. That's just talking about becoming friends. She had never been kissed or had anything resembling a relationship before and while we both were clearly developing feelings for one another, she just never acknowledged it directly. The best way to put it is that when I began testing the waters and flirting, making my interests known she was receptive but very passive. For example we started hanging out one on one a lot, going for walks, getting coffee/meals on campus, just sitting around and talking for hours. Sometimes on a walk, I would take her hand, or when talking sit next to her with my arm around her. She would allows follow suit, and grab my hand tight, or cuddle up into my shoulder, but she would never acknowledge the physical boundaries being crossed.

I had just gotten out of a pretty timultuous breakup from my first LTR and was really trying not to just fall into a rebound, so while I was developing feelings for her I didn't want to rush anything or ruin anything. On top of that, like you said, it was hard to get a read on her. From her body language she was into me as well, but she just was completely friendly (nothing more) and never flirted beyond light stuff friends will throw to one another. I wasn't that afraid she didn't like me romantically at all, but I couldn't tell for sure.

Things really came to a head at the end of one walk which brought us overlooking the sun setting over the edge of campus. We stopped and stared as it went below the horizon. Without even thinking I just walked up slowly behind her and wrapped my arms around her waist. I pulled her in and rested my chin on her shoulder. She just relaxed into me, and for a few minutes we just stood there, sharing this intense, intimate moment together. As we broke that embrace, walking back hand in hand, she again said nothing, she just was glowing and grinning, but only talked about how nice the sunset was, not us or what we shared.

That's when I realized things are just going to keep escalating into a more and more confusing limbo unless one of us finally says something... and I realized that someone was going to have to be me.

That night we had a long talk over coffee, where I finally just asked her point blank how she felt about me/us and I told her how I felt (that I really was developing strong feelings for her but wasn't sure if I was ready for a relationship so soon). She finally outright said she had romantic feelings for me as well, but she was in no rush for anything, and admitted she had no idea what she was doing, as she had zero relationship experience. We both talked about it and decided since there was only two weeks left to the semester, that we would remain friends through the summer, then see how we both feel when we came back in the fall. We hugged and continued talking about other things until the coffee shop closed.

As I was walking her back to her dorm, we once again started holding hands. It was an automatic response. It just felt right. I also knew that if we went along with our plan, there was a chance the spark would die being apart for two months, the chemistry would fizzle out as scenery changes. I knew I couldn't give up without first giving it an honest chance. I felt like I was about to let something amazing slip away. I stopped in my tacks, she felt the tug on her hand and stopped, looking at me. She asked what was wrong.

I was just grinning, my heart pounding. I just said ""about what we agreed to back at the coffee shop, forget it"". She looked confused. ""I don't want to wait and see what happenes. I know my feelings for you and I know your feelings for me. I want to make this work, do you want to be my girlfriend, right here, right now"". She just kind of froze for a minute, but she eeked out a ""yes"" and we embraced. She was kind of shaking the whole way back to her building. I could tell she was both happy and scared shitless at the same time. As I said goodnight and made plans to grab breakfast the next morning, I could tell I would be overplaying my hand going in for the kiss that night as well. We hugged for an incredibly long time, and I think she even started crying a bit. As I walked back to my dorm, I was trying not to get ahead of myself, but part of me felt like one part of my life just fell perfectly into place that night. So far, I've been right about that one."

If they hide it from because ""I might be mad"" then I'd probably ungirlfriend them, not because I am ""mad"" but because they're assuming I'd be mad over something they can't control, which isn't the case and they clearly don't know me that well if they think that."

My advice? Don't ever be the first to mention not wanting kids. Ask them with a neutral question or even one that sounds like *you* want kids. I hate to say it like this, but a lot of women will outright lie just because they think you'll change your mind.

r/AskMen,"Straight dude here. I'd be swimming in dick if I were gay. It's especially depressing considering the ratio of gay men vs. straight women out there. I can hardly get a Tinder match with women, but gay men have tried going through my partner (we're polyamorous) to get to me.  She has a bisexual friend who currently has a thing for me. One guy on Tinder saw me in one of her profile pics and said he wanted to suck my dick. I can give lots of other examples. But women? I get no such attention. 

I can't explain it."
r/AskMen,"This is an 'it depends' answer.   I suspect many men would date her for a while, but the vast majority would move on after a period of time and not want to marry her.  Men are easily swayed by beauty, but at some point that wears off and reality sets in.  

&#x200B;

Also the attractiveness of the guy plays into it.   The more attractive the guy, the less likely he is to date her at all as there are other better options available.  the less attractive the guy, the more likely he will be to date her for a longer time - even up to marriage - as he will ride on the 'i am way out of my league here' wagon."

r/AskMen,"From personal experience I would say start working out. Nothing improves my self esteem like getting a little fitter. Also it always helps if the ladies notice but hard to control that. 

Also find a skill making something you enjoy. Wood working, building computers, paint. Whatever. Just find something you love that makes something.

Also acceptable if you fix something. Fixing something that was broken always helps me. Essentially listen to Ron Swanson."

r/AskMen,"1st and 2nd dates - Always have a place to hang out after dinner. Even if it is just walking around a mall. It allows you both to quickly assess whether or not the date went well, and expectations on the later texts. 

Since we've been communicating via text a bit, I ask that before the date, we come up with purposely awkward questions, or something with an embarrassing answer/story. it helps break the ice and laugh at ourselves. It went really well on the two dates I used it on. Makes us more humble and less putting on a front of how a perfect human we are."
r/AskMen,"Virtually never. 

Back in late 2011, I had a friend on deployment overseas. He didn't really have internet access out there, so I packed a portable hard-drive with as much shit as was humanly possible.. Movies, tv shows, video games, and a whole lotta porn.  When i heard back from him, I was apparently quite famous around the base.


Outside of that, I haven't really sent porn to friends."

r/AskMen,"Dated a girl for 2 years in high school who had a HUGE sex drive, but was determined to wait until marriage to have sex. The whole relationship was a cycle following this pattern:

Step 1) Start dating, spend all our time together
Step 2) Be hormonal teenagers who both want sex
Step 3) Become gradually more intimate as time passes
Step 4) She arbitrarily decides we've ""gone too far""
Step 5) She FREAKS OUT and tells me I pressured her into it and I'm dragging her down
Step 6) She leaves me a guilty emotional wreck
Step 7) after a few weeks she gets horny again and calls me

I finally left her and moved away after high school, but I had a guilt complex about physical intimacy for years after that. The thing that finally helped me ""get over"" it was to let myself be vulnerable. I spent a few relationships convinced that every fight we had was secretly caused by my ""unwanted"" sexual advances, but I eventually dated a girl who was willing to put to with my junk and reminded me regularly how normal and healthy it was too want sex with your S.O., etc. Her catchphrase used to be ""I'd be more upset if you DIDN'T want to bone me!""

I am now healthily and happily married (3 year anniversary is this month) and the missus and sex regularly."
r/AskMen,"It was a short but very intense nightmare. I guess the problem was that she was on the light side of both. So, no banging the door 23 times or interrupting her own sentences with total different new topics.

She was having meltdowns for misaligned things (glasses, forks, pens). She started to sort my books on color. Thankfully, she got distracted. That's the good part of dating the mix. The worst is when only one is active. Like the last time her ADHD flared was at her BFF's birthday party and she gave a handjob to the husband! So distracted! It wasn't his birthday!! Her childhood BFF was not very compassionate and understanding about this. I laughed and laughed and left her there and then. Good that we didn't live together. Good that she had to walk a mile through the snow in high heels and a flimsy dress. Oh, tempora!

Where were we? Right! Guess it depends. Depends only on both of you, how willing are you to make it work, to put in the effort

OCD is no excuse for being a dick nor ADHD for not being loyal"

r/AskMen,"I'd want to be told, can't evaluate where I need improvement unless someone tells me what the problem is.  Doesn't mean I'll agree, but I'd prefer to not me left wondering.

For example; met up with someone and she was pretty nervous around me.  Turns out since I was so much bigger than her I was really intimidating how I threw myself around.  I thought I was being outgoing but she took it differently.  Up until then I didn't think that being 6' and muscular was a big deal because I used to be 6' and super fat.  In my mind I was small, in her mind I was huge and intimidating."
r/AskMen,I always wipe after I pee
r/AskMen,"How muscular is muscular?  Really need a point of reference or two here, OP."
r/AskMen,">My end goal is to go on a few dates with somebody who works in the store. 

They can tell, and that makes them uncomfortable. This in turn makes them act differently towards you that with other guys who aren't projecting hope or expectation (*yes, you are, trust me.*) Women have a 6th sense for identifying men who are needy, over keen or thirsty, and it makes them not like those men. When men say ""stop giving a fuck,"" it means ""relax, let go of the outcome, drop your expectations and just be cool, casually friendly and treat people like you don't need anything from them."" Which is excellent advice.

Guys often find that women are far warmer and flirty as soon as the guy gets into a relationship. Why? Because he's not projecting such needy vibes any more now that he's got a woman, and this allows other women to lower their guard around him."

r/AskMen,"I got married to someone I had been seriously dating for about two years, 1 year of solid dating, and about a year of engagement. She had self harm issues (cutting mostly, but also burned herself, a d struggled with bulimia) she did an extremely good job of hiding it from me while we dated, partly because we never lived together until we were married, and partly because I mustve just been oblivious to some of the signs, but for whatever reason I genuinely had no idea what she was going through until we were married and moved in together. I wanted to help her and didnt know how so I spent a few weeks going to therapy myself just to learn how to be supportive, instead of my previous mentality which was ""dont do that, you're not supposed to do that"". It took me quite some time after learning how to be supportive to her to actually convince her that she needed help. We were young and didnt have a lot of money, and she didnt want her family or mine finding out what she was doing so asking for financial help from either of our families was not an option. I decided that if she would go to the therapy then I would find a way to pay for it. So for the next 8 months I worked every hour my job would allow, often working double 10 hour shifts several days a week, taking naps in my car when I could. I spent any available time I had either trying to help take care of our apartment, family obligations, or actively going to therapy with her to try to make sure I was doing the things I needed to be doing to not actually be counter productive to the process of her learning how to cope with her problems in a better way. We covered my absence to our families while I was working by saying that we were trying to buy a house and wanted to save up as much money as we could so nobody would really guess what the real story was. Fast forward to the end of the 8 month timeline and because nobody really knew what was going on, her friends had convinced her u was a workaholic that didnt care about anything but money, and instead of outing herself as having a problem she went along with what they thought and often said about me. I guess after some time she convinced herself I probably didnt really have to work as much as I had been and started accusing me of  being unhappy at home and avoiding her by going to work. Around that same 8 month mark was when she really started to show signs of getting better when it came to dealing with things and wouldn't you know it, once she gained her own self confidence and stood on her own two feet she decided that cheating on me with her boss, getting pregnant by him, and proceeding to tell my family I was a workaholic that never came home and it drove her to someone else. I've never outed her to either of our families to this day, and weve been divorced since about 2 months after I found out she had cheated and gotten pregnant. That was 5 years ago and nobody knows that entire story, unless she has told anyone because I never did to anyone except my current fiance' who wanted to know why I got divorced. I tried to help her the best I could and all I got was completely screwed over in every way possible."
r/AskMen,"I'm 25, in the army. I joke about cock sucking and gay sex and it's all fun and games till I met a sergeant who is 45 if not older and does the same shit. And while thanks to my baby face I still look stupid, he simply looks sad and that's towards what I'm heading, if I won't be careful."

r/AskMen,">I can't understand why, on the flip side, this type of person would be drawn my way in return?

Anything that is markedly different from me or my experiences is going to get my attention. I think that's where the initial interest comes in.

""Oh, this person is really interesting and different! Look at all the stuff they give a fuck about! And look at how many fucks they give!!""

It's cool for a while, then I get to a point like, ""Fuck...she cares about EVERYTHING. And way too much. And she keeps thinking I should care how she feels just because she feels it. Ugh.""

I mean, the people I fall in with tend to be emotionally intense to the point of emotional *instability* (where they are hampered or deeply bothered by things that really have no impact on or connection to them), and that shit gets old. 

When someone cares way too much about way too much, I start to desensitize to the point where I don't care at all how they feel.

At this point, if I'm drawn to someone, I immediately step back and assess, because they're probably *interesting to me*, versus *compatible with me*."
r/AskMen,If he's as into you as it sounds I doubt it matters much what you wear
r/AskMen,"The whole institution of the proposal (at least in its most Rom-Com form) is odd to me: if you're approaching marriage as something substantively important, it just does not seem like a good idea to me to propose it in a way that's as much as surprise as possible, and then usually expect an answer after almost no thinking time. Possibly a good way to pressure someone into marrying you (cf also public proposals), not a recipe for a good marriage IMO.

I think it's good to talk this stuff over so that the proposal is almost a formality, and I also don't think the gender of the person proposing matters at all. But, that said, some people are going to want a maximally traditional proposal, which is planned and fairly dramatic and with 'the man' proposing and 'the woman' accepting. Without knowing your \[hypothetical?\] girlfriend, if marriage is important to her, maybe (\*maybe\*) that's a possibility; and if so, waiting any amount of time probably isn't going to lead to a proposal.

So, I've rambled, but my general thought is that it's good to talk it through, even if just in the sense of feeling it out in the abstract and trying to figure out what kind of proposal she'd be most comfortable with"

I made sure to choose one that understood the concept of a relaxing spa treatment and not just another place with noisy blow dryers, smelly nail acrylics, etc.  I went with her and they sat us down in a waiting room where I almost fell asleep. It was dimly lit, super soft loungers, hot tea, soft music playing quietly overhead. That was the waiting room. They took her back to a warmed table for a massage and then a facial under a warming blanket.  I went across the street to an antique shop for the hour.  I'm still being rewarded for that.  Even hints that I might do it again gets her in a mood to reward me."

Coincidentally, that was her best freind. I think it was the only time anyone has ever given me advice based purely on the fact they didn't want to see me hurt... except that one time my uncle yelled at me not to crawl under a car that was resting on a hydraulic jack."

r/AskMen,"Work out/get in shape. Have a well put together life and a defined trajectory toward success in your career field. Be self reliant. All of this will give you big time confidence so you can just do what you want and get what you want and if you don’t get a certain guy then who gives a fuck? Plus only douchebags are attracted to girls who just want to be hot. Real men think hot is women who stay in shape, stay smart, and have life goals they’re driven toward."

However, the majority of women I’ve known have all been either manipulative, dishonest, or otherwise indirect. Why is that?"
r/AskMen,"I feel like a lot of girls on Tinder dont actually intend to go on dates with guys. They just swipe and if you message, they may or may not respond. If you let the conversation drag on too long they get bored and go to sleep, so its better to be more direct. Thats been my experience at least."
r/AskMen,"I'm gonna disagree with the reddit circlejerk on that one, not showing emotion is manly. Ask anyone and they'll have heard of that stereotype, and what defines something as ""manly"" is entirely based on stereotypes. Not saying showing emotion is bad, just do what comes naturally to you. Trying to show more or less emotion to appear more or less manly won't work."

r/AskMen,"Laying someone off is always difficult. Where I work we try to help find them a new position and I do my best to negotiate a package. It’s best to give them as long a notice period as you possibly can.

Firing someone is different. I have only been involved with firing two people and in both instances their were sufficient warnings and help offered. The final firing decision was made by Human Resources not myself.  Even so if there are unavoidable personal circumstances around the firing our HR still offers help after the person is fired.

That said it’s almost always “you knew this was coming”. Immediate dismissal is again more an HR decision. 

Lay offs are definitely harder."

r/AskMen,"It's made my social life difficult, but that's more due to my parents living in a different town than my friends do, so now I do too. Not so much the actual living arrangements.

Some people definitely look at me weird when I mention it, but once I explain the situation they're usually pretty understanding. It helps to have an actual plan to get back on your feet and working at that. If I had no intention of moving out again that'd be a different story entirely.

The worst of it all is really just waking up every day with the thought in the back of my head that I'm in this attic room because I failed at adulting. (There are some circumstances, but we're our own worst critic.)

All in all, we just make the best of it. I'm saving up money, helping around the house. Just taking advantage of the few upsides this arrangement has, really."
r/AskMen,"I'd say a lot of guys are decent at hiding it. I'm as anxious as they come and have zero confidence around women but when I'm around a very attractive one I can still act normal. It's only when they leave do I fall apart. In fact, the other day I was helping out a friend film stuff, her friend was the subject/actor/model and she was insanely hot.

r/AskMen,"I'm the girl in that situation, so I can tell you first hand that complimenting her and pointing out all the good in her -body and personality wise- is a great way for her to stop feeling that way.

Then one day on a work trip he wanted to look at uggs for his daughter and asked me to get him a pumpkin spice latte at starbucks and his image was blown for good :D"
r/AskMen,I’ve gone to whole metal/rock festivals alone. You meet all kinds of cool ass people that way.

r/AskMen,"I talked to this beautiful woman for a good week she was about 5 years older than me and fine af

Down side was she had 3 kids, didn't have citizenship  and didn't really work much... At 23 I figured I don't need all of that extra baggage. 

My oh my tho she was gorgeous and actually into me."
r/AskMen,Music
r/AskMen,"I think on a personal level time spent on politics would be better served on improving your own situation (learning skills, applying for higher paying jobs, etc.)"
r/AskMen,Idk but there’s this guy at my school who pulls his pants down all the way and gives us a full view of his ass
r/AskMen,"I was a very violent bully because I felt shit about myself. I would have loved my father paying more attention to me. Explaining how my actions could take effect. I hated everyone. I would pick smaller and weaker kids, befriend them and then abuse them as in making them my slaves, beating them, going to their homes and fight them etc..... I never learned how my actions could form people. My parents were very nice and sweet people but I was a horrible orc of a human and they never punished me."
r/AskMen,"No more waking up in the pitch black morning.

I really like there being sunlight."

It is written for people just starting out managing their money, and for people who don't enjoy reading finance books."
r/AskMen,Ask them if she could fit in a rowboat
r/AskMen,"I would visit you and then answer this question while you were dreaming by making you think I was the reason you asked the question in the first place. (Inception style)

*come to think of it, are you dreaming right now? Maybe this life is just a dream..."
r/AskMen,"Guy - big dick

Gal - bigger dick"
r/AskMen,"My dog and sobriety. I’m happier at work, my romantic relationship is healthier, I’m just all around better. Whenever I got bored and got the urge to go pick up some beer or whatever my choice was I’d take the dog for a walk and talk to him out loud... Sure I may have looked crazy but life is good man."
r/AskMen,"12, to some weird tentacle shit I found somehow. I don’t even remember how I found it. I don’t want to remember lmao"
r/AskMen,We never get compliments so at least personally I’m usually caught off guard or it just doesn’t compute because it’s so rare
r/AskMen,"Im now happily married, so i would say quite well."
r/AskMen,"Plenty of times. 

- Condoms suck

- Somtimes I'm just not in the mood for it I guess.

- Somtimes the girl I'm with isn't a great lay."
r/AskMen,"Truth be told is you're not getting ""burned out at work"" you are just burned out. Not enough sleep means you aren't doing the best job at work, which leads to stress, which leads to not enough sleep, etc.

Talk to your SO. See if she's doing plenty at home, or if she could be doing more at home so you can relax quicker... Talk about backing down at work and getting a more consistent schedule. Definitely attempt to re-prioritize your life. If you've been doing this since before your son, then you should consider trying to find something that gives you the consistency for enjoying your sons life.

You are leaving your twenties soon (me too!) we now need the 8-10 hours of sleep, not 5 hours and a shot of espresso. Find time for yourself, your life, and your health. You are taking on too much. You should be able to plan things with your family."
r/AskMen,Ant Man can get pretty big.  I'm assuming it scales up so he's probably in the running.
r/AskMen,I made myself an even better person and started to love myself. Never been happier.
r/AskMen,"Do you have any idea the length that some guys go to, lying and manipulating, just to get laid?"
r/AskMen,Media mines Reddit for content all the time. Comments of mine have appeared on all kinds of clickbait and trash media websites. I remember how but there was a way to search your username on google but excluding all reddit results. A bunch if us here did it a while ago and tons of of us had been mined for content.
r/AskMen,Best 30 seconds of my life
r/AskMen,"My 15 year old son is intellectually disabled, very honest and has zero filter. A few weeks ago he was talking to his grandmother all about how much porn he is going to watch when he is 18. 

Honestly, I think it will be yet another I see nothing I hear nothing moment in my parenting career."
r/AskMen,"Yes of course. 

Only an unenlightened clodhopper would ever believe we can for one moment kick back and say ""welp, that's it, I'm perfect, no more lerninz"". So yes, I have had things to teach her and she me.

> I just thought there must be the same experience from the opposite side too, but I hear it being spoken of far less. (I think I've heard it only once TBH...)

Because of the deleterious narrative that girls are so much more grown up and adult and men are eternal manchildren, with which women love to flatter themselves.

> what aspect did you teach her and how did that turn out?

I'll gloss over  things I consider nonsense like housekeeping skills and cooking.

Patience is a big one. She'll never be the most patient person on the planet, but she violently explodes to people's faces far less easily than she did when we got together. And it affects so many things.

Learning to accept, but also master some of her fears.

And so on and so forth."
r/AskMen,"Sounds like you found one of those invertebrates. No spine to say what she wants.

Idk tho. Need to just ask her or move on."
r/AskMen,Distraction. Showing him rather than telling him you’re there for him.
r/AskMen,I've been in a few. I won more often than I lost.
r/AskMen,"A girl from school I hadn't talked to in years randomely text me. We are chatting for a bit and she starts saying she once had a sex dream about me. Why I never made a move. She had a rush on me etc etc etc. Fuck it, I'll ask you out now then, I think.

&#x200B;

Na fuck it she has a boyfriend and I'm a pig apparently.

YOU TEXT ME AND BLATENTLY HIT ON ME !!! Fuck sake. I still don't know what she wanted."

r/AskMen,"When giving me the tablet I would use for work, my director asked me not to use it for personal things and keep all of my activities in it work related. He then proceeded to tell me about the woman who worked in that position before me and how she took naked pictures of herself for her boyfriend, but forgot to erase them before returning the tablet to the company.

That was fine, but then he pulls out his phone and shows me the pictures he's saved for his ""personal use during bathroom breaks"", giving me a wink and referring to her as ""the slut who kept begging for cock"". That was my very first day at the job."
r/AskMen,"I think ""Wow! She is really beautiful!"" and then I continue on with my day and completely forget about her 5 seconds later."
r/AskMen,That guy is extremely vague
r/AskMen,"Give me a place to shower, and maybe help me get to interviews. Gotta grind."
r/AskMen,It takes effort to maintain healthy relationships even with family. Treat the situation like as if he were just someone you liked and wanted to get along with better. No just a guaranteed buddy because you are family.
r/AskMen,Dropping the transmission on my truck.
r/AskMen,That’s between you and your SO.
r/AskMen,"People are extra nice to you regardless of context.

&#x200B;

People have different body language when they talk to you. They tend to not cross their arms as much, make more eye contact, lean in to listen to you when you talk."
r/AskMen,"After the second ditch I always put it like ""why don't you text/call me when you know when you are free""

They never do.   And I don't expect them to.   You are being given a big hint."
r/AskMen,Damn you thicc
r/AskMen,"Look, I heard that there was a study (and I've been promising myself to find and verify that it actually exists for 10 years :D :D :D ) that looked at the effects of everyday journalling on people's tendency to procrastinate.

Scientists took a group of volunteers and ordered them to get a notebook and do a simple thing: on the left side of the spread, they had to write down their planned results for the day; on the right side, they had to write down what has and has not been done by the end of it.

If you want to try some solution, this might do the trick. Or, start reading reeeeeally old literature. Start with Sun Tzu's ""the Art of War"" if you haven't yet."
r/AskMen,"I guess I was the worst hook-up...?

Basically this guy was bi-curious, so his first time with a guy was me -  halfway through he said ""I'm definitely straight"".

Played video games with him for the rest of the night though -  still good friends."
r/AskMen,"Very happily married for 22 years.  I speak to everybody with the same boundries, male or female, it doesn't matter. Treat everybody with the same level of respect.   But ,if you're unsure of how ""safe"" to keep a conversation with a married person, a easy rule is to not say anything to them in private that you wouldn't be 100% comfortable saying to them in front of their spouse."
r/AskMen,"Personally, unless they can give me an okay reason, I just write off people who flake. 

If I wanted to date flaky people I could just find the next 50 on every dating app"
r/AskMen,I would love it so much n keep going until she taps out
r/AskMen,She could have not been so wild and rebellious causing our parents to clamp down and me and my sister for everything because they think we will do the same.
r/AskMen,"My wife and I started as friends, and initially she didn't return my romantic interest.  That changed a couple years later.  It's never bothered me.  People change."

r/AskMen,"If the therapist doesn't fit: Search another.  
In Germany, every health insurance pays for up to 5 sessions to test.  


My story is rather short:  
After my second failed suicide attempt i had to do something.  
Found a therapist, got SSRI ( Selective **Serotonin** Reuptake Inhibitor ) for a year or so to get through the worst part of my depression.  


To test your chemical imbalances is a start.  
Just look up depression factors.   
You find a lot of things that influence your body towards depression.  
Work on them."
r/AskMen,"She had to take a phone call in the middle of sex. Her boyfriend was in prison, so any time he called, she kind of stopped anything she was doing to talk to him. I hung out naked on the bed while she had a call that was exactly 15 minutes. Weird, but 10/10, worth it and would do again."
r/AskMen,"well, ideally before you have unprotected sex with them!"
r/AskMen,Don't be fat. Hip to waist ratio is key
r/AskMen,My online research if you wanna call it that is usually seeing what's on her IG or Snapchat Story before I try and take things further. You'd be surprised how many red flags you can spot by seeing what she posts about over the course of a weekend.
r/AskMen,You lock eyes and finish what you started
r/AskMen,Shoot guns
r/AskMen,"There’s a super easy way to handle this: you make the approach incidental. Eg. If the girl is at the bar you go up to the bar to get a drink next to the girl but Do not pay attention to the girl. If she doesn’t want attention she will keep a neutral gaze or in the opposite direction of you. 

If she is receptive she will look towards you and then you can start your opening line."

r/AskMen,I was productive and studied for my exams
r/AskMen,"I just turned 26 last week, jesus.

Inside I still feel like I'm 16, but on the outside I look... old. It's weird, my wife and I just visited an old friend who's still in college, and he happened to be having a little party with college friends. I get along and have more in common with those 18-19 year olds than I do with my 30-40 year old coworkers. 

Man I don't know where I fit, but I shouldn't be this old. I literally spent hours drinking tequila and playing with fucking beyblades last weekend. One of those nerds has practice swords and we swung those around for a bit."
r/AskMen,"1. As a Californian, take fire safety seriously! Fire is one of the best parts of camping, but if there’s a high fire warning in effect in your area don’t shoot guns, don’t set off illegal fireworks, and make sure all your cigarettes and joints get properly disposed of. *That said...:* It’s SoCal, you have places like Niland and the Salton Sea that are deserts... so go nuts if there’s nothing to burn down!

2. Drugs: Make sure everyone is on the same page with what (if any) drugs are going to be involved. Camping is great for stuff like pot and LSD, not so great for blow and trucker speed.

3. Music! Get some instruments and go full hippy. Or get a decent battery powered amp, I guess.

4. If there’s a place to swim, get a *hilarious fuck ton of floaties* and duct tape them all together. Bonus points for making a floating cooler.

5. Night lighting. Get some small battery powered blinky lights (or make your own LED throwies) and set them high up. It’s a fun ambiance and will help your friends on LSD find the camp after they decide to walk a mile away for no reason at midnight.

6. Remember: tents are not sound proof. If you’re inviting couples, encourage them to go fuck up in a tree and not disrupt everyone’s breakfast with their pacman-esque blowjob sounds"
r/AskMen,Dude where's my car?
r/AskMen,"Friendships don't happen naturally unless you're forced to talk to someone as told by the situation at hand.

It'll happen naturally after you force it to start. Like a snowball falling down a hill. It's just gonna sit there until you give it a nudge, then it'll come rolling down in an avalanche."
r/AskMen,"Eh, you just kind of wait it out. For me there is no real reason as to why it happens. Men just sometimes don't entertain the idea of sex."
r/AskMen,Lo-Fi Hip Hop with the space girl
r/AskMen,"Ease into it. I know exactly what youre talking about, i know it can be hard or even downright terrifying. But talking to someone who wants to know this kind of stuff about you is all sorts of rewarding. If you dont know anyone like that personally then i would suggest trying online therapy. There are a few sites that provide free counseling services, betterhelp.com is one that i know of. But if that seems a bit too impersonal or would make you uncomfortable then feel free to message me. Ive been dealing with depression for over a decade so if you want, i am more than willing to talk or even just listen. Help is always available to those who seek it, you just have to be brave enough to do so"
r/AskMen,"Since I have a really high libido, most times they were a little confused and hurt, but were understanding.

Sometimes, I had to go on a lengthy discussion to help 'em understand that there's nothing wrong with them, they're still beautiful in my eyes, there's no one else, I'm still in love, I just worked 12 hours, got my ass kicked in boxing class and my dick is just physically unable to get hard right now.

I was called gay twice."
r/AskMen,"""When can I drop by to get the ring back?"""
r/AskMen,"Sleep over, It's her decision.

If she's my girlfriend I want to spend time with her.. I'm not pushing the girl I love away because she's on her period. Doesn't matter how long we've been together."
r/AskMen,"Fine, so long as it’s reasonable. It’s better than her wanting to spend less time with me lol"
r/AskMen,"Pain killers

r/AskMen,"We're exchanging privacy and individual liberty for convenience and ""safety"" and nobody seems to care"
r/AskMen,"I have no problem with women being honest about liking me, but it's good when they have high standards for me - vet me properly, encourage me to demonstrate to you that I'm the real deal before you make the best of yourself available to me. It'll bring out the best in me and get us started on the right foot."
r/AskMen,I ate a whole jar one time and drank the juice and woke up in the middle of the night to take the most violent shit of my life
r/AskMen,What do i need to do to get laid?
r/AskMen,Yes. Tease them. Anticipation is one of your greatest tools in the bedroom.
r/AskMen,"I would delete it if someone found out it was me; not because I post things that I'm ashamed of in any way, but I'm here for the anonymity. Once that's gone, it's gone. And I'm gonna have to start over."
r/AskMen,Within a year or two.
r/AskMen,"Currently go through the withdrawals. Suggestion to help out getting better: start a note on your phone of all the ways that they were wrong for you. For example: my fling was CRAZY BEAUTIFUL. Us together looked like if Shakira and that Hurley kid from lost had gotten together. One issue I brushed off but later realized was a pretty bad trait of hers was her narcissism. Her dog acting out to a neighbor, geez somehow it was their fault. Her never remembering promises she made of reaching out or going out wherever, she just has a short term memory and can only remember if it’s important enough to not on the calendar. 
Go through the memories and catalog all the problems that rubbed you the wrong way and keep that list building. Whenever the feels get to you and you want to chase that dragon again by stalking the social platforms— reach for that note instead and reread/add to it. Broken hearts leave a void like addicts chasing a fix, don’t feed it, take the time to consult on it.
It’s a long road but it will eventually start feeling better not having that stress of them haunting you."
r/AskMen,"If it sounds scientific but you heard it on a day-time talk show for middle-aged women, it's bullshit"
r/AskMen,"Saw how long she could go without texting me when she finally texted she said “hey”, now mate since I’m a stereotypical guy i didn’t tell her how i felt not talking to her for so long so just played it cool. Don’t do that please, you will be miserable and feel like you cant trust the other person in the relationship."
r/AskMen,"Start with giving some time for just doing whatever the fuck you like, but don't harm your body"
r/AskMen,Was fat still did ok with the ladies cause I was the funny friend who sometimes got a shot. Lost weight suddenly more women would talk to me but I wasn’t used to it. It was weird and tbh prefer when girls like me for me. Change in jobs made it hard to workout and have gained a lot of weight back. Found I netted out with more hotter friends because they got to know me when I was skinnier but kept me around cause they like me as a person. If I had to pick between the two I prefer having the weight and attention because the like me for who I am.
r/AskMen,"Presented her with a wooden box full of of photos of us, notes we'd written each other, and screen grabs of emails & texts we'd sent to one another over the previous three years."
r/AskMen,I make the next guy look amazing
r/AskMen,I’ve been using urinals since I was probably 5 years old. The urinals at school back then went all the way down to the floor to accommodate for all the kids K-8.
r/AskMen,That I'm no longer an innocent 11 year old
r/AskMen,"Cars/racing

r/AskMen,"I dont think theres anything in comparison. Women wear makeup and it can definitely change the look on a womans face. Hair extensions etc. 

But, as a man, I like to look good. I even apply lotion so I dont have a dry face. I style my hair and wear cologne. But that's all we CAN do... unless some guys wear eye liner.."
r/AskMen,"You come to the realizations that:

1.  You, and only you, are responsible for your situation and the grievances you have arising from it. 

2.  If you fail to take that responsibility you are giving up the only mechanism of control that you have over your life for no other reason than to indulge your ego.

and finally

3.  That events in you life are neither good nor bad and are both simultaneously.  Those events can either strengthen or weaken you.  You decide what effect they have on you and thus whether or not they are negative or positive."
r/AskMen,Big trouble in little China. /thread
r/AskMen,I hold it like it is mine. What is someone going to give me shit for holding a purse? fuck 'em.
r/AskMen,I speak my mind. Even when I probably shouldn't or at least not be as blunt or straightforward.
r/AskMen,"Yes. Same as keeping a ""cum rag"" around."
r/AskMen,"Was taking Ambien for insomnia... had to get off it pretty quickly because I kept hallucinating like crazy. Saw a panther jump out of my wall and over my head... then kept seeing kids everywhere with clocks for eyes. I was starting to wonder if I lost my mind or I was just seeing things. Luckily it was the latter, but I became super paranoid of even being conscious."
r/AskMen,A vagina
r/AskMen,"Was at a gay bar with my gay bros and a guy started hitting on me, told him I appreciated it but I'm straight, and he told me that any girl would be lucky to have me since I'm so handsome. Trying to get in my pants or not, thanks my dude."
r/AskMen,"Aside the from the fact that you drove twice as long as the date...count your blessings. She didn't waste more than an hour of your time by pretending to be interested.

Are you mostly put out by the amount of time your drove? Would you feel upset if you walked 5 minutes and the date ended in an hour?

It's like a speed date...you chatted for an hour, and then that was the end. If there was chemistry in that hour, there will be follow up. Otherwise...next..."
r/AskMen,"For me it's all about routines. Once I get used to something, I do it without thinking. So I forced myself to go to the gym almost every day for two weeks and it was hard. After that, it was just something I did. Full auto pilot. Only got to fill my water bottle, put it in my prepared bag, put on my headphones and walk to the gym for a few minutes. Doesn't matter what time of day or if it's shit weather."
r/AskMen,"A stereotype says men think about sex every 8 seconds, but that is so stupid. No guy stops thinking about sex for 7 whole seconds."
r/AskMen,"Currently sober, but it’s ten AM, and my home has void of alcohol since noon Thursday."
r/AskMen,"As a catch-all, ""Give a shit."" I know low-maintenance is awesome for us because being lazy is the best, but it doesn't take a whole lot of effort to make a difference. 

Don't use the three-in-one body wash/shampoo/conditioner, find stuff that's actually better for your hair and spend three minutes longer in the shower using it properly. Don't use 48-hour deodorant because it's *not*. Floss, brush, mouthwash. Comb or style your hair instead of just drying it off after the shower and wearing it like that.

Adding 15 minutes to your morning routine to do everything properly makes a big difference in how you look and feel."
r/AskMen,"I may do things very differently than others but I don't remind myself of a single goal I'm fighting for, instead I have daily, weekly or monthly goals I work towards. I think of it like new years resolutions, if I have a vague goal I'm fighting for, chances are I'll never get there. If I set small, attainable goals, they're much easier to attain. 

Currently, my monthly goals are to get settled into my new job, to get out with friends at least once and to get better at lock picking (hobby I picked up recently.) They're not super ambitious this month but it makes me feel productive. If I have 3-5 goals a month, thats 36-60 things a year which is pretty satisfying in hindsight."
r/AskMen,"I'm gonna say something, that most women say to insult us and we just shrug it off but its true and you tell anyone ill deny it till i die BUT.........We only use blood at one head at a time."
r/AskMen,"For a first date, I have almost always suggested coffee. It's public, so we both feel safe. It's inexpensive, so neither of us feels put out if it doesn't go well. It's easy to shorten or extend, so that we can adjust to fit our moods in the moment.

For a first date, I just need a venue to hang out with somebody and get to know them. I really don't think that a first date needs to be some knockout amazing activity... but more than that, try a few strategies and see what works for you.

Some people don't like coffee so much, but my experience has been that they'll usually counteroffer with something else that's similar, which is fine."
r/AskMen,"The only time I can recall was in high school. I dated this girl for 2 years and we had a fallout, but still together on and off. I eventually left her for a new girl who came to our school. I regretted it once I realized it was only lust for the new girl and that my feelings were still strong for my ex. She ended up dating some kid who was in the movie ""holes"" at the time and brought him to school dances. It was really surreal, but we later reconnected after high school fir a brief period.

r/AskMen,"I'm not ALWAYS in a good mood, but I'd say I am more than most people.

The key is to know what you can handle. If you're confident in yourself, you know you can get through most things so you don't stress. And remember the ten day rule. ""Will this matter in ten days? No? Then no point in getting mad about it."""
r/AskMen,"Moved to another country. At 17. Stupidest thing I've ever done and we broke it off soon after.

r/AskMen,"I was in a relationship once, and I remember every compliment she said to me.

Men getting complemented is a rare occurrence so we tend to enjoy it. It makes up our week haha."
r/AskMen,The fear that this will be the jar I cannot open.
r/AskMen,"I married her!

The first hookup was a mixture of awkward and comfortable. After the first hookup, that awkwardness disappears as though it was never there. But, that first hookup awkwardness is just something you have to get through.

My wife and I met each other about 10 years (prior to first hookup). We kind of hit it off and became friends from the first time we met. Although she was set to marry her fiancé at the time and I just got out of a particularly bad breakup.

4 years after that I was running around like a male slut and she’d split with her husband. We didn’t hookup just yet but our friendship was getting stronger. Over the next few years we’d become best friends and celebrated our hookups and cried together about our breakups.

We were like BFF’s. Then I had enough and just told her how I felt about her. We have been together ever since."
r/AskMen,Attraction to others when in a committed relationship is normal. Acting on it is cheating.
r/AskMen,"Giving you a girl's perspective (hope that's ok), I think definitely the best thing you can do is lend your ear and listen to her. If you're both willing, maybe talk through and help her investigate them? you're obvs not a shrink but some reassuring words would help. 

Sometimes all we want is just to be heard and feel validated. 

&#x200B;

hope this helped in any way"
r/AskMen,"You totally forgot ""flavor"""
r/AskMen,"Best case scenario, it's nothing to worry about.

Worst case scenario, it will fall off by morning and you'll have a girlfriend instead of a boyfriend.

In all honesty though, I'd get it checked out by a doctor. Better to be safe than sorry."

r/AskMen,the sloth...so relaxed 😀
r/AskMen,I can’t speak for everyone but I in now way can see my relationship with my brother deteriorating in such a way. We haven’t argued since we were children and I can’t imagine the situation it would take for us to get upset with each other.
r/AskMen,I get about 4-5 hours a week but I stay up a little later and also have another baby ( again #5) lol.. usually an hour a night after every goes to sleep .. 2 years will get better tho .. oh and PS4
r/AskMen,When you have no arms or legs
r/AskMen,"Well it just depends on the scenario

At a canteen or bookstore? Just approach them and use an ice breaking line like what they would suggest to eat, to read etc etc 

At a grocery store? Most people don't like to be annoyed while grocery shopping so if you must then just ask for their opinion on a certain item you're looking to buy but have no clue about

At a bank or any related place? Abort man, don't even try"
r/AskMen,"I commend your sensitivity to other people’s comfort levels. Take care that it doesn’t shade into letting them dictate your behavior entirely, though."
r/AskMen,"I never ""chose"" to do that, so i will say this... NEVER sell your life to a company, i have missed a few opportunities doing this.

As for doing it alone, well the accounts, paperwork and staff control are always an issue, going it alone is way more than working at what your good at."
r/AskMen,"That i am a whole diffrent person when away from family, and that i'm not a push over and i actually do talk to people"
r/AskMen,"Pretty much everything.  First house I bought I tried to do everything myself. Way too many lessons learned, but best one was don’t try to cut through an old plaster ceiling on a Sunday evening because you might hit a water pipe, flood your kitchen, and of course you can’t get a plumber in until tomorrow so you have no running water for 24 hours."
r/AskMen,"I need to actually see a naked woman, the sears and robuck catalog won’t get it done any more."
r/AskMen,"I'm Asian, so I look my age (31) with a beard or stubble and I look 14 when clean shaven."
r/AskMen,"Super helpful advice from my therapist: ask the person what they think their options are.

I know it sounds really simple, but I have used this method in so many situations and it really, REALLY helps. It allows the person to break down the situation for themselves and still come to their own conclusions, while showing that you are actively listening, and that you see there's a problem, but you aren't trying to make it about you or offer advice when you might not fully understand it.

Give it a try when there's a slight pause in the venting. If you ask it calmly and in a friendly way, I've seen it help bring people from angry venting down to thoughtfully analyzing the situation and usually they feel better when they start looking at things in this way. Hate your coworkers? Hate your neighbor? Hate your schedule or habits? What can you do about any of this? Thinking about your many (or unfortunately few) options can help bring acceptance to the situation -- after a good vent of course.

&#x200B;

edit: it also comes off way better than ""you should try..."" or ""have you done..."" because that's probably just going to piss the person off more. the point is to help them find their OWN answers."
r/AskMen,The blank stares of all my victims
r/AskMen,"First off, tell her that she shouldn’t be “exaggerating” her responses and communicate like an adult if she wants to be satisfied.

My SO admitted that I hadn’t been making her come when we first started dating because I was rushing the foreplay, so I told her we’d take our time, and eventually we figured it out. I’m not gonna lie, my ego took a hit too, but if you can take criticism and work together you’ll both be happier in the end."
r/AskMen,"You, my friend, are being used as a boyfriend substitute. Aka, you get to do all the emotional hand-holding, ""make me feel important, wanted, pretty"" that a boyfriend would be called upon to do... without any of the benefits of being a boyfriend (being interested in YOU, wanting to hear about YOU, companionship.... sex).

> It's obvious to me that she likes me in a romantic way 

Are you sure about that? Are you sure that when she txts you or speaks to you on the phone there isn't a picture of ex-BF's face taped over the screen of her mobile or computer screen? and what you are mistaking for romantic interest is merely her pretending that you're her boyfriend?

Its up to you. If you don't mind being emotional support crutch, go ahead, text her back. Tell her things you know she wants to hear. And if you don't mind being a rebound in a few weeks when you meet in person, go for it. Could be a wonderful weekend, or week or however long it lasts. But I would not anticipate this turning into a long term thing. Not yet anyway. 

Just don't go and do something stupid like fall head over heels for her in a few weeks then be crushed and vulnerable when you separate again. Go into next week with the attitude of: _hey, Im good for friends... friends with benefits... but I am not interested in anything long term. Just a good time with someone I'm interested in, but only temporary. And if long term things happen later on thats great but Im not interested in that right now._"
r/AskMen,"I'm only 19 so take my advice as just a suggestion

r/AskMen,"Met a gorgeous woman who had come from abroad to make a home for herself where I live. We hit it off, there was a bit of friction from my family initially after I introduced her but I tried to smooth things over.

Things have been a bit complicated since then."

r/AskMen,"My grandparents (I only got to know my paternal ones, as my maternal ones died before I was born) were loving, fearless people who loved learning, and could talk to any stranger like they were their best friend.  I want those traits for my children.

But the hardest lesson they taught me was a little darker.  They got married right after WWII and lived in the south.  They were racist.  Not KKK burning crosses racist, but ""that's how things are/were racist""  they liked that ""colored girl"" who was their neighbor, but couldn't grasp why they shouldn't say ""colored girl"" in the 90's.  I would cringe every time.  Now, with my parents, they'll say something about gay people or something around my kids, and I get the same feeling.  I've learned what kind of parent/grandparent I want to be.  I never want my kids to have to apologize for me by saying ""that's just how things were in his time"".  I don't have to be hip or cool, but I do have to keep living in the real world, even if the changes scare me."
r/AskMen,Cliche as it may sound but music somehow keeps me going
r/AskMen,Copious amounts of Whisky! Love that shit.
r/AskMen,"Eh, a burden shared is a burden doubled in my experience, so I would never want to and would never try to talk about what's bothering me. Especially since I have a SO who already has anxiety and depression. I'd just pull her proverbial boat under the waves. 

I'd just tell her, ""I'm feeling stressed. Let's get high."" or just go read a book."
r/AskMen,"I remember it fondly...

I put the shift lever in my hand, trembling with excitement. My legs shook like jackhammers from all the nerves.

I shifted to drive and rolled forward slowly as I feathered the brake and turned the steering wheel gingerly. 

Looped the parking lot once, stopped, shifted to park, and shut off the car.

My first time driving was awesome."

r/AskMen,"If you need to ask, you can’t afford it."
r/AskMen,"I didn’t and I lost her.

Edit: the reality is I had two options. I could have let her in and maybe she’d still be here, maybe she wouldn’t. But not letting her in insured that she wouldn’t be. At the end of the day you have to decide what’s more important, feeling safe or her."
r/AskMen,"If he’s not willing to seek help, you should. How long until he goes from hitting the steering wheel to hitting you?"
r/AskMen,"Mmm.. spouse and kids *are* my family.

If you mean parents, all the time. We moved halfway across the world. With parents being old, we visit them separately, each one of us once or twice a year, so that we get more frequent face-time with them. Both of us visit both set of parents, with spending a little more time with their own parents then with the spouse's."
r/AskMen,"I don't know if you would consider this or not...

&#x200B;

But my family is made up of all christian folks and they're all very old women. I'm often called over to fix computers, help them build decks or install doors, fix mechanical equipment like lawn mowers, and so on.

&#x200B;

Every single time, without fail, when I tell them I have finished whatever I was summoned to do, they immediately thank God for fixing their problem. I have never been given credit a single time. Ever. It was God every single time.

&#x200B;

It is immensely frustrating but I just kind of deal with it because I love my silly, backwards family despite their faults and they usually take me out for a good meal after."

r/AskMen,"Got married a few weeks ago, so far it's exactly the same but now I have a nice ring and a bunch of cool memories from an awesome wedding, and I'm enjoying the feeling if being married. Also my wife has been more gushy and excited about being by wife, I'm sure that'll wear off a bit but it's fun right now. The way she says her new name just because she likes how it sounds and then smiles is so cute."
r/AskMen,Browsing reddit?
r/AskMen,"I’ve been the job seeker as well as having supported during a time when my girlfriend was finishing her degree and working. In my opinion the best thing you can bring is a positive attitude and be ready to lend an ear to his frustrations. This will be one of those listen don’t fix style support requests where he already knows what he needs to do probably so he may just need to vent every once in a while.

Calm and positive is what he needs right now."
r/AskMen,"You mean find them hot? Most of them, makes me proud they tricked a pretty girl into marrying them hahaha.... If you find you have a crush on one, you just nip that shit in the bud, no one needs to know, and you need to stop."
r/AskMen,"I live alone too. If I'm  sick, I'll make a plan and take an hour to deal with all the necessary errands. Run to the grocery and get plenty of soups, fruits, drinks, meds, and whatever I may need to last enough time for me to not have to go out. Fortunately the nearest grocery also has a pharmacy, so I get meds picked up there. After that I just try to stay cozy and recover at home without wasting much energy."

The entire process takes about two hours.  I usually read books for those two hours, others watch TV or nap.  Donating blood products is good for your health as it prevents excess iron stores and keeps your bone marrow in tip top working condition. And it saves lives, allows surgery to happen and replenishes platelets in chemo patients.  Win-Win"

r/AskMen,"> I definatly don't want to have sex with anyone unless I'm in a commited relationship

Sounds completely fine.

> Would you say that most men (my age) don't want to be with a girl who they will have to wait with?

Shouldn't matter to you. Don't run after what most men would do. Do what you are comfortable with."
r/AskMen,"I don't know your specific situation, but is there ever a time it's NOT a good idea to ""push thru - trauma or not""?

&#x200B;

I mean, you're passing up opportunities for what reason exactly?  I don't think you're supposed to stop living life to ""work on yourself"".  I think, unless whatever you're going through is debilitating, it's always time to get a grip.  I meet a lot of people in my field (coworkers not patients) who think that if they work on themselves in regards to mental health it means taking meds and going to therapy and eventually they will ""get right"".  It doesn't work that way.  Everyone is fucked up in some way or another, and while not everyone can just decide to push through or ignore the shitty things, most people can and choose not to.

Just my two cents as a dude that works with the severely mentally ill."
r/AskMen,"General consensus seems to be that it originated in Chicago, Illinois as a slang word used to refer to young, affluent, white men in the suburbs. The term was later popularized by the satirical Lincoln Park Chad Society and other online forums and was submitted to Urban Dictionary in 2006.

As far as why not ""Dave"" or ""John"", my guess is that those names are just not distinctive enough.

Stacy's or Trixie's are the female counterpart.

r/AskMen,"Years ago (Jan. 2000) got the call that my father had died, went over to my boss who was one of the owners of the company and told him the news and that  I wouldn't be back for a few days. His immediate and honest reaction was *""That's terible! Of course, you just go and don't worry about it, but come to see me in my office before you leave today""*. 

I went to his office before leaving and he gave me his condolences and then told me "" I know we have 3 days of grievence leave but you take whatever time you need and we'll still pay you, and, (Hands me a corporate credit card) take this with you, not for the basic expenses but just to help with anything unexpected while you're gone"".

>What touches do you notice the most during a first date?

I... Don't notice touches in particular. Maybe because I'm a very physical person myself, so touching my dates is kind of standard for me. I do like when they're physical, but I don't really have a favorite. Snuggling up to me during a movie does sound lovely.
